This paper identified geospatial data as a long-term, interdisciplinary need that would necessitate increasingly complex infrastructures to manage. The authors concluded that these infrastructures would likely be prohibitively expensive for each CIC library to maintain individually, and they proposed collaborative solutions for the long-term management of geospatial resources.\n\nBidney, M., Mattke, R. & Weessies, K.

Additional authors: Luyu Liu, Ph.D., Auburn University; Harvey J Miller, Ph.D. The Ohio State University.\n\nPublic transportation offers a sustainable, environment-friendly, and equitable mode of travel, particularly for marginalized and disadvantaged groups. However, the first-mile/last-mile (FMLM) access problem can pose significant challenges to its efficiency and ability to generate accessibility. An incomplete sidewalk network reduces transit accessibility by creating barriers, especially for sidewalk-reliant groups such as people with mobility disabilities, elderly, and school children. In this study, we develop new metrics to measure the impacts of sidewalk incompleteness on transit FMLM accessibility. Using data from Columbus, Ohio, USA, a typical mid-sized American city with an incomplete sidewalk network, we apply these measures and compare them to the sociodemographic characteristics of the neighborhood surrounding each stop. We find that the sidewalk network and high-quality sidewalk network have 45%-50% less spatial coverage around bus stops compared to street networks, respectively. 39% and 49% of bus stops provide access to fewer groceries and healthcare facilities, respectively, when following sidewalk networks. We observe that inner-city neighborhoods, despite being less affluent, often have better sidewalk access compared to affluent suburban areas. However, peripheral to city-center and less-affluent neighborhoods exhibit a cumulative burden with the poor sidewalk access that impacts access to essential resources such as groceries and health care. The research provides a direct and comparative measure of FMLM accessibility and suggests a strong linkage of urban morphology with sidewalk accessibility. This study calls for targeted sidewalk improvements and a nuanced understanding of accessibility gaps to promote equitable and efficient public transportation systems.\n\n---\n\n#### Presentation 2: Integrating Behavioral Science with Spatial Modeling to Target Fertilizer Reduction Campaigns\n\n👤 Qian Lei-Parent, University of Connecticut. Additional authors: David Dickson, University of Connecticut; Jamie Vaudrey, University of Connecticut; Robert J. Johnston, Clark University; Tom Ndebele, Clark University; David Newburn, University of Maryland; Derek Wietelman University of Maryland; Haoluan Wang, University of Miami; Kaichao Chang, University of Maryland.\n\nNitrogen (N) from residential lawn fertilizer is an increasing concern for the Long Island Sound (LIS) watershed due to its contribution to water quality impairment. While the impacts of excessive fertilization on coastal waters are well known there is a need to understand behaviors by residential households to guide behavior-change campaigns and attain N-reduction goals.  This presentation describes a GIS-based approach that integrates predictions of household fertilizer use with N loading and transport models to estimate the potential for reducing N delivery to the Sound through behavior-change campaigns. Specifically, our approach integrates multiple models including: (1) econometric modeling that uses survey data and household characteristics to predict parcel-level residential lawn fertilizer applications, (2) a biological model that estimates the nitrogen loads applied to landscape from residential fertilizer application, (3) a spatially explicit nitrogen transport model (N-Sink) to predict nitrogen loads to LIS, and (4) contingent behavior modeling to examine willingness to reduce fertilizer use in response to prospective policy interventions. The products of the study have been made available to stakeholders through an interactive web tool built in ArcGIS Experience Builder. This tool aims to help behavior-change campaigns target areas where they can have the greatest impact on LIS water quality.\n\n---\n\n### SHORT BREAK\n\n---\n\n### Session 2: GIS and AI Solutions for Complex Challenges\n\n🕚 11:00 - 12:00 pm CST\n\n_Facilitator: Kathleen Weessies, Michigan State University; Slide operator: Colleen Wilson, University of Minnesota_\n\n#### Presentation 1: Detecting Legend Items on Historical Maps\n\n👤 Sofia Kirsanova, University of Minnesota. Additional authors: Weiwei Duan, Inferlink; Yao-Yi Chiang, University of Minnesota.\n\nDetecting and localizing legend areas, including individual legend symbols and their text descriptions, in scanned historical maps is a crucial step in automated map interpretation. This study explores the effectiveness of multimodal language models for detecting legend items, their descriptions, and link the detected legend to their corresponding descriptions.  We use in-context learning, where the GPT-4 is given examples in the prompt to guide its predictions, instead of training it from scratch. The model’s accuracy is tested using F1-score and Intersection over Union, which measure how well it detects legends and their locations. Results show that adding more examples improves accuracy up to a point, but too many examples cause the model to overfit, so it makes predictions less reliable.  Findings highlight the limitations and scalability of in-context learning for structured object detection tasks and provide insights into optimizing large language models for spatially aware text-to-image relationships. In addition, this is part of the DARPA USGS funded project on AI for map Geolocation and Extraction to find Critical Minerals (AIM). The results help to improve AI-driven map analysis which makes it easier to locate and study important map features, such as those related to mineral exploration and geospatial data integration.\n\n---\n\n#### Presentation 2: Value Added Remote Sensing: Integrating Machine Learning from the Lakebed to Grapes\n\n👤 Phillipe Wernette, Michigan State University. Additional authors: Bob Goodwin, Michigan State University; Nick Weil, Michigan State University; Erin Bunting, Michigan State University.\n\nImprovements in remote sensing technology have enabled us to collect significantly larger data volumes across large areas more efficiently than ever before. With these new data comes new challenges, such as sorting through and analyzing the data and then serving it to the stakeholders and/or public. Here, we seek to leverage automated photogrammetry processing coupled with machine learning (ML) models to (1) process and present large volumes of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) imagery across the Great Lakes lakebed and (2) identify, segment, and quantify wine and juice grapes from mobile LIDAR and structure from motion (SfM) point cloud data. Results from the lakebed project demonstrate that photogrammetry can improve our data to information pipelines by reducing data redundancy and effort during processing, while still retaining high-accuracy and high-resolution data. Ecologically valuable information (e.g., substrate composition, invasive mussel abundance and distribution, and fish and crustacean habitat use) can be automatically extracted from the resulting point cloud, digital elevation models, and orthomosaics with relatively simple ML models. Results from the viticulture project highlight the need for continued technological improvement with mobile LIDAR, but also the important role other data and ML models can play in developing automated methods of monitoring agricultural production. Fusing ML models into data-to-information pipelines can streamline an otherwise time-consuming process and enable researchers and stakeholders to better focus on the science and management implications of the new information.\n\n---\n\n#### Presentation 3: Urban Socio-Environmental Vulnerabilities Dataset\n\n👤 Juan Fernando Martinez, Columbia University - Center for Integrated Earth System Information (CIESIN). Additional author: Dana R. Thomson, CIESIN.\n\nThe Urban Socio-Environmental Vulnerabilities dataset analyzes climate risks and vulnerabilities in global cities where urban populations face multiple environmental stressors. These areas experience high urbanization trends, substantial climate risks, and opportunities for adaptation investments to enhance resilience. The analysis examines pre-existing environmental vulnerabilities—including extreme heat, water scarcity, cyclone wind, storm surge, riverine flooding, landslides, and air pollution—alongside future climate risks. By integrating novel high-resolution spatial datasets, the study identifies urban areas exposed to multiple environmental hazards and estimates the total and percent of the urban population at risk.  Climate risks often compound, particularly the interaction between extreme heat and water scarcity, which disproportionately impacts vulnerable communities. These risks strain health systems, worsen air pollution, and threaten food and water security. The findings provide a data-driven foundation for policymakers, researchers, and urban planners to prioritize adaptation investments, especially in cities where the convergence of climate risks and rapid urbanization demands urgent action. This research underscores the need for improved climate data, particularly for sub-city analyses, to enhance urban resilience planning. Addressing data gaps—such as those related to flash flood risks—will strengthen future assessments and inform more effective climate adaptation strategies at local, national, and regional levels.\n\n---\n\n### LONG BREAK\n\n---\n\n\u003C!-- WORKSHOP -->\n\n### 🧰 Workshop: Getting Started with Cloud-Native Geospatial: Tools, Data, and Scalable Workflows\n\n🕚 12:30 - 1:00 pm CST\n\n**Topics Covered:**\n\n\u003Cul>\u003Cli>What cloud-native geospatial means, why it matters, and how it improves data access\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to work with modern formats like GeoParquet and Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs using tools like QGIS and Python\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to access and explore data with Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to scale your spatial analysis using distributed computing tools like Apache Sedona\u003C/li>\u003C/ul> \n\n**Resources Mentioned:**\n\u003Cnl>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/?.language=en\">STAC Browser\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis_plugin_gpq_downloader/\">QGIS GeoParquet Downloader\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/\">CNG Guide\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://cloud.wherobots.com/auth/register\">Wherobots Community Account Sign Up\u003C/a> (specific notebook: /examples/Getting_Started folder once you sign up)\u003C/li>\u003C/nl>\n\n**Bio: Matt Forrest**\n\nMatt Forrest is a geospatial professional focused on education and scaling technology.

Beavers slow and store water in their ponds, canals, and the surrounding soil during flood events, which can then be accessed by riparian vegetation during droughts. As a result, the well-watered vegetation in beaver-dammed riparian corridors is less flammable during wildfires. I use satellite remote sensing to understand how these beaver-influenced patches of the landscape function as climate-resilient natural infrastructure and provide ecosystem services to other wildlife and to people.\n\n**Bio**\n\nEmily Fairfax is an Assistant Professor of Geography at the University of Minnesota and an affiliate faculty member at the Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory. Dr. Fairfax double majored in Chemistry and Physics as an undergraduate at Carleton College, then went on to earn a PhD in Geology with an emphasis in Hydrologic Sciences from the University of Colorado Boulder. She uses a combination of remote sensing, modeling, and field work to understand how beaver ecosystem engineering can create disturbance-resistant patches in the landscape under a changing climate. Her research has been featured internationally in _National Geographic, the New York Times, the LA Times, PBS, NPR, BBC, Vox_, and others.\n\n---\n\n### SHORT BREAK\n\n---\n\n### Lightning Talks \n\n🕚 2:15 - 3:00 CST \n\n_Facilitator: Nicole Scholtz, University of Michigan; Slide Operator: Méch Frazier, Northwestern University_\n\n1. **The Role of Fear and Creativity in the World of Maps**\n\n    👤 Arpan Yagnik, Penn State University\n    \n    The complex interaction of imagined reality, subjective reality, and objective reality will be explored by using the constructs of fear, creativity, and AI in the context of the world of maps.  The development of maps has been fundamentally driven by the fear of the unknown and the creative impulse to manifest new worlds. Early cartography arose from anxieties surrounding uncharted territories, dangerous coastlines, and imagined landscapes. This transformed fear into actionable spatial knowledge, with creativity serving as a tool to discover what lay beyond the horizon. Once territories were mapped, the fear of loss, distortion, or reduction of these mapped territories spurred further technological advancements, fueled by creative problem-solving. Creative maps, Artistic maps, and counter-mapping projects, born from creative reimagination, challenge dominant narratives and shape public discourse. This creative reinterpretation of maps can foreground marginalized perspectives, fostering empathy, critical engagement, and influencing public opinion. The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the world of maps, and its interplay with fear and creativity, remains a critical area of inquiry. Technology-led mapping remains an area of skepticism and fear due to the potential risks of data breach, algorithmic bias, and surveillance. This talk discusses the convergence of fear, creativity, and AI to explore a previously neglected perspective on the world of maps. By analyzing maps through the lens of fear and creativity, we can gain fresh insights and stimulate new ways of thinking about the role and significance of maps, which are essentially visual narratives of the known and unknown.\n    \n    ---\n\n\n2. **Conservation on a Slippery Slope: Using GIS and Remote Sensing to Predict and Prevent Land Degradation**\n\n    👤 Ethan Bledsoe, Northwestern University\n    \n    Amidst Ecuador’s cloud forests, where conservation and development collide, soil erosion threatens biodiversity and local communities. Using ArcGIS Pro, Google Earth Engine (GEE), Python, and high-resolution remote sensing, I mapped erosion risks in Manduriacu, a region where steep slopes and land-use changes endanger fragile ecosystems. By integrating these outputs into the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), I quantified erosion risk through key factors: R-factor (rainfall erosivity), K-factor (soil erodibility), LS-factor (slope steepness and length), C-factor (land cover), and P-factor (conservation practices). My analysis pinpointed severe soil loss near roads, deforested areas, and the Manduriacu Hydroelectric Dam, where infrastructure has destabilized surrounding slopes. By overlaying my results with hydrological flow accumulation models, I identified sediment transport pathways threatening local waterways. Field validation with conservation rangers confirmed exposed root systems and degraded slopes in high-risk zones, strengthening the model’s predictive accuracy. To enhance this analysis, I used GEE’s cloud-based processing to automate NDVI classification, linking vegetation loss trends to topographic and hydrological factors. Leveraging Sentinel-2 imagery, I conducted NDVI time-series modeling, applying linear, spline, and moving average interpolation to detect vegetation loss patterns over time. These insights directly informed Fundación Ecominga’s reforestation priorities by pinpointing degraded areas most in need of intervention, optimizing efforts to stabilize slopes and restore biodiversity. In this talk, I’ll explore how geospatial analysis transforms conservation planning — demonstrating how satellite-driven NDVI forecasting, cloud computing, and erosion modeling can bridge the gap between remote sensing and on-the-ground reforestation strategies to protect Ecuador’s cloud forests.    \n    \n    ---\n\n\n3. **Teaching about Communities: Integrating Open Geospatial and Map Resources into Projects**\n\n    👤 Tara Anthony, Penn State University\n    \n    This session will highlight course activities, instructional initiatives, and library engagement activities focused on community projects using open government geospatial, maps, and GIS resources. Resources highlighted include the BTAA Geoportal, open government GIS sites including ArcGIS Hub sites and data portals, along with map resources. This lightning talk will highlight activities for group assignments, individual activities, and student employee engagement activities to help foster greater awareness of community GIS resources for teaching, research, and engagement purposes. This session will highlight strategies for integrating activities focused on communities into geospatial projects based on an academic library setting, and a selection of course integrations applying GIS to projects.\n     \n    ---\n\n4. **Geographic Information Integrated with Genomic Information for Wildlife Conservation**\n\n    👤 Jong Yoon Jeon, Purdue University; Additional authors: Andrew N. Black, Purdue University; Natalie M. Allen, Purdue University; J. Andrew DeWoody, Purdue University\n    \n    Many contemporary populations are threatened by habitat loss (ecological vulnerability) and a lack of adaptive potential (evolutionary vulnerability). Ecological and genomic attributes of populations can provide two orthologous perspectives on the biological profiles associated with conservation challenges. Together, GIS and modern genomics help identify the environmental and genomic conditions that should maximize fitness and thus population productivity. Here, I illustrate representative approaches to combine GIS and population genomics. I first introduce recent approaches that combine modern genomics and ecological niche modeling to identify and conserve local adaptation profiles. I then introduce the idea of distilling genomic information into thematic GIS layers. This integration of genomics into GIS thematic layers will help convey the implications from genomic datasets to nonspecialists to help better inform applied conservation management and associated policy. I provide several examples relevant for conservation, including my own research, that illustrate how this integration of GIS + modern population genomics could be realized.\n      \n    ---\n\n5. **Developing the Washington State Food Rescue Map**\n\n    👤 Mariah Rubin, University of Washington\n    \n    Food insecurity and food waste are persistent challenges in Washington state. Over 2 million residents face food insecurity, while more than 1 million tons of food waste—including 390,000 tons of edible food—are generated annually (Use Food Well Washington Plan, 2022). Food rescue presents a solution to reduce food waste and improve food security. In 2015, the Washington state legislature set a goal to cut edible food waste by 50% by 2030, tasking the Department of Ecology (DOE) with tracking progress. However, scattered data and limited tools have hindered these efforts.   Our University of Washington team developed the Washington State Food Rescue Map with the best available data to support DOE’s mandate to collect and monitor food waste reduction efforts, identify data gaps, and support opportunities for preventing food waste through food rescue. Our team leveraged the expertise of hunger relief organizations across Washington by conducting a survey and in-depth interviews. This provided insights for assessing their current food rescue practices and capacity to accept food donations, identifying barriers and opportunities for improving and expanding food rescue, validating the map’s data layers, and understanding how the map could rescue more food. The findings and mapping products from this project will equip decision-makers with the tools to make data-informed decisions that will reduce the distance that excess food travels to increase food safety, reduce carbon emissions from transportation, and address food security gaps in overburdened and underserved communities.\n   \n    ---\n\n6. **Identifying Car Locations and State Using Deep Learning**\n\n    👤 SM Ahsanullah, The Ohio State University\n    \n    Urban vehicle detection and classification remain critical for traffic management, urban planning, and smart city initiatives. This research explores the use of ArcGIS Pro’s deep-learning models to analyze high-resolution satellite imagery, aiming to identify vehicles and classify them as either moving or parked. By leveraging existing pre-trained models and retraining them with supervised data from the target urban area, we achieve a workflow tailored to the city’s unique conditions. Georeferenced satellite imagery with an inherent coordinate system ensures that each detected vehicle’s location is accurately mapped, streamlining the process of spatial analysis.  To distinguish moving from parked vehicles, spatial context plays a pivotal role. Parking lot boundaries and street parking zones are integrated into the analysis, allowing vehicles detected within these areas to be classified as stationary. In contrast, vehicles in known travel lanes or away from parking zones are more likely to be moving. The research demonstrates how geospatial features combined with deep learning output can produce reliable vehicle state classifications, without the need for time-sequenced imagery.  This method represents a scalable, efficient approach to urban vehicle monitoring, contributing valuable insights for urban planners and transportation managers. It highlights how off-the-shelf deep-learning capabilities, enhanced with domain-specific training data, can be applied to solve real-world challenges. The results lay the foundation for more sophisticated analyses, such as traffic flow optimization and parking demand prediction, supporting smarter, more responsive cities.\n   \n    ---\n\n### Session 3: GIS for Equity and Engagement\n\n🕚 3:00 - 4:00 CST\n\n_Facilitator: Karen Majewicz, University of Minnesota; Slide Operator: Sue Oldenburg, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey_\n\n#### Presentation 1: Map Making: Fostering GIS and Makerspace Inquiry through a Collaborative Data Physicalization Project at a Liberal Arts College\n\n👤 Tracy Tien, Wellesley College; Additional authors: Allegra Dufresne, Wellesley College; Johanna Okerlund, Wellesley College\n\nWe conducted a multi-year initiative to engage the Wellesley College community with interdisciplinary GIS and making methods through a participatory data physicalization activity that transformed a library hallway wall into a large-scale map. The first iteration (2024) consisted of using a Cameo paper cutter to create foldable, origami-style pyramids, inviting the community to delineate a Massachusetts land use and land cover map. The second iteration (2025) expanded to experience GIS layers tactilely with two layers: using the same paper pyramid method for a wall map of nighttime lights on the Korean peninsula, and a second, semi-transparent and moveable layer made out of PVC pipe, wire fencing, and cross-stitched yarn to overlay population density.   This presentation will detail the project's evolution, including logistical challenges, outreach strategies, desired learning outcomes, and observed results. Overall, we found the ease and familiarity of craft-based engagement correlated with the extent to which community members made the activity their own and the spectacle of a large in-progress project was an effective magnet for gathering and conversing, but it was challenging to channel this interest into deeper engagement. Furthermore, we will delve into broader conceptual considerations as they relate to the liberal arts context, taking a critical look at what the project says about the relationship between data, materiality, labor, and learning.\n\n---\n\n#### Presentation 2: A 3D GIS Web Application for Map Library Exploration\n\n👤 Jose Anza Garcia, University of Maryland; Additional author: Milan Budhathoki, University of Maryland\n\nAt McKeldin library, we are lucky to have one of the largest map collections of any college library in the world. With over 200,000 print maps, including government maps provided through the Federal Depository Library Program, the collection is an important repository of print geographic materials that serves millions of people. However, the collection's size and complexity, which has prevented the creation of a comprehensive catalog of every individual item, makes it daunting for users to explore and find materials. To tackle this problem, the library's GIS and Data Services team created a 3D model of McKeldin's map collection using ArcGIS Pro and extensive field measurements. The model was deployed to a custom web application by leveraging ArcGIS Online and JavaScript mapping libraries, allowing users to search the collection by map category, cabinet number, or keyword and interact with the results in a realistic, intuitive 3D environment. This project seeks to bridge the gap between print and digital geography by showing that digital solutions can enhance the reach of print geographic materials in an increasingly Internet-centered world.\n\n---\n\n#### Presentation 3: Mapping Innovation: How a Century-Old Institution is Advancing Equity with GIS\n\n👤 Jarell Brown, The Henry Ford\n\nIn a world where inequities and barriers continue to shape educational outcomes, what if maps could be the key to fighting them? This session will explore how GIS technology can be used in creative ways to break down barriers to equity and innovation by making data accessible to the change-makers who need it most. It’s not just about creating maps—it’s about using data to uncover systemic barriers and spark real, transformative change. The Henry Ford’s Innovation Atlas is one powerful example of how GIS is reshaping the way we understand and address K-12 innovation. But this session is not just about showcasing a tool; it’s about rethinking the very concept of what GIS can do. We’ll explore how spatial data can reveal hidden inequities, support inclusive policy development, and drive community engagement in ways that go far beyond the conventional map. You’ll leave this session with concrete, inspiring examples of how GIS is creating a more accessible and equitable world.

Additional authors: Luyu Liu, Ph.D., Auburn University; Harvey J Miller, Ph.D. The Ohio State University.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Public transportation offers a sustainable, environment-friendly, and equitable mode of travel, particularly for marginalized and disadvantaged groups. However, the first-mile/last-mile (FMLM) access problem can pose significant challenges to its efficiency and ability to generate accessibility. An incomplete sidewalk network reduces transit accessibility by creating barriers, especially for sidewalk-reliant groups such as people with mobility disabilities, elderly, and school children. In this study, we develop new metrics to measure the impacts of sidewalk incompleteness on transit FMLM accessibility. Using data from Columbus, Ohio, USA, a typical mid-sized American city with an incomplete sidewalk network, we apply these measures and compare them to the sociodemographic characteristics of the neighborhood surrounding each stop. We find that the sidewalk network and high-quality sidewalk network have 45%-50% less spatial coverage around bus stops compared to street networks, respectively. 39% and 49% of bus stops provide access to fewer groceries and healthcare facilities, respectively, when following sidewalk networks. We observe that inner-city neighborhoods, despite being less affluent, often have better sidewalk access compared to affluent suburban areas. However, peripheral to city-center and less-affluent neighborhoods exhibit a cumulative burden with the poor sidewalk access that impacts access to essential resources such as groceries and health care. The research provides a direct and comparative measure of FMLM accessibility and suggests a strong linkage of urban morphology with sidewalk accessibility. This study calls for targeted sidewalk improvements and a nuanced understanding of accessibility gaps to promote equitable and efficient public transportation systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"presentation-2-integrating-behavioral-science-with-spatial-modeling-to-target-fertilizer-reduction-campaigns\">Presentation 2: Integrating Behavioral Science with Spatial Modeling to Target Fertilizer Reduction Campaigns\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#presentation-2-integrating-behavioral-science-with-spatial-modeling-to-target-fertilizer-reduction-campaigns\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Presentation 2: Integrating Behavioral Science with Spatial Modeling to Target Fertilizer Reduction Campaigns”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>👤 Qian Lei-Parent, University of Connecticut.

While the impacts of excessive fertilization on coastal waters are well known there is a need to understand behaviors by residential households to guide behavior-change campaigns and attain N-reduction goals.  This presentation describes a GIS-based approach that integrates predictions of household fertilizer use with N loading and transport models to estimate the potential for reducing N delivery to the Sound through behavior-change campaigns. Specifically, our approach integrates multiple models including: (1) econometric modeling that uses survey data and household characteristics to predict parcel-level residential lawn fertilizer applications, (2) a biological model that estimates the nitrogen loads applied to landscape from residential fertilizer application, (3) a spatially explicit nitrogen transport model (N-Sink) to predict nitrogen loads to LIS, and (4) contingent behavior modeling to examine willingness to reduce fertilizer use in response to prospective policy interventions. The products of the study have been made available to stakeholders through an interactive web tool built in ArcGIS Experience Builder. This tool aims to help behavior-change campaigns target areas where they can have the greatest impact on LIS water quality.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"short-break\">SHORT BREAK\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#short-break\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “SHORT BREAK”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"session-2-gis-and-ai-solutions-for-complex-challenges\">Session 2: GIS and AI Solutions for Complex Challenges\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#session-2-gis-and-ai-solutions-for-complex-challenges\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Session 2: GIS and AI Solutions for Complex Challenges”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>🕚 11:00 - 12:00 pm CST\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Facilitator: Kathleen Weessies, Michigan State University; Slide operator: Colleen Wilson, University of Minnesota\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"presentation-1-detecting-legend-items-on-historical-maps\">Presentation 1: Detecting Legend Items on Historical Maps\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#presentation-1-detecting-legend-items-on-historical-maps\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Presentation 1: Detecting Legend Items on Historical Maps”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>👤 Sofia Kirsanova, University of Minnesota.

This study explores the effectiveness of multimodal language models for detecting legend items, their descriptions, and link the detected legend to their corresponding descriptions.  We use in-context learning, where the GPT-4 is given examples in the prompt to guide its predictions, instead of training it from scratch. The model’s accuracy is tested using F1-score and Intersection over Union, which measure how well it detects legends and their locations. Results show that adding more examples improves accuracy up to a point, but too many examples cause the model to overfit, so it makes predictions less reliable.  Findings highlight the limitations and scalability of in-context learning for structured object detection tasks and provide insights into optimizing large language models for spatially aware text-to-image relationships. In addition, this is part of the DARPA USGS funded project on AI for map Geolocation and Extraction to find Critical Minerals (AIM). The results help to improve AI-driven map analysis which makes it easier to locate and study important map features, such as those related to mineral exploration and geospatial data integration.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"presentation-2-value-added-remote-sensing-integrating-machine-learning-from-the-lakebed-to-grapes\">Presentation 2: Value Added Remote Sensing: Integrating Machine Learning from the Lakebed to Grapes\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#presentation-2-value-added-remote-sensing-integrating-machine-learning-from-the-lakebed-to-grapes\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Presentation 2: Value Added Remote Sensing: Integrating Machine Learning from the Lakebed to Grapes”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>👤 Phillipe Wernette, Michigan State University.

With these new data comes new challenges, such as sorting through and analyzing the data and then serving it to the stakeholders and/or public. Here, we seek to leverage automated photogrammetry processing coupled with machine learning (ML) models to (1) process and present large volumes of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) imagery across the Great Lakes lakebed and (2) identify, segment, and quantify wine and juice grapes from mobile LIDAR and structure from motion (SfM) point cloud data. Results from the lakebed project demonstrate that photogrammetry can improve our data to information pipelines by reducing data redundancy and effort during processing, while still retaining high-accuracy and high-resolution data. Ecologically valuable information (e.g., substrate composition, invasive mussel abundance and distribution, and fish and crustacean habitat use) can be automatically extracted from the resulting point cloud, digital elevation models, and orthomosaics with relatively simple ML models. Results from the viticulture project highlight the need for continued technological improvement with mobile LIDAR, but also the important role other data and ML models can play in developing automated methods of monitoring agricultural production. Fusing ML models into data-to-information pipelines can streamline an otherwise time-consuming process and enable researchers and stakeholders to better focus on the science and management implications of the new information.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"presentation-3-urban-socio-environmental-vulnerabilities-dataset\">Presentation 3: Urban Socio-Environmental Vulnerabilities Dataset\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#presentation-3-urban-socio-environmental-vulnerabilities-dataset\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Presentation 3: Urban Socio-Environmental Vulnerabilities Dataset”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>👤 Juan Fernando Martinez, Columbia University - Center for Integrated Earth System Information (CIESIN). Additional author: Dana R. Thomson, CIESIN.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Urban Socio-Environmental Vulnerabilities dataset analyzes climate risks and vulnerabilities in global cities where urban populations face multiple environmental stressors. These areas experience high urbanization trends, substantial climate risks, and opportunities for adaptation investments to enhance resilience. The analysis examines pre-existing environmental vulnerabilities—including extreme heat, water scarcity, cyclone wind, storm surge, riverine flooding, landslides, and air pollution—alongside future climate risks. By integrating novel high-resolution spatial datasets, the study identifies urban areas exposed to multiple environmental hazards and estimates the total and percent of the urban population at risk.  Climate risks often compound, particularly the interaction between extreme heat and water scarcity, which disproportionately impacts vulnerable communities. These risks strain health systems, worsen air pollution, and threaten food and water security. The findings provide a data-driven foundation for policymakers, researchers, and urban planners to prioritize adaptation investments, especially in cities where the convergence of climate risks and rapid urbanization demands urgent action. This research underscores the need for improved climate data, particularly for sub-city analyses, to enhance urban resilience planning. Addressing data gaps—such as those related to flash flood risks—will strengthen future assessments and inform more effective climate adaptation strategies at local, national, and regional levels.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"long-break\">LONG BREAK\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#long-break\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “LONG BREAK”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C!-- WORKSHOP -->\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"-workshop-getting-started-with-cloud-native-geospatial-tools-data-and-scalable-workflows\">🧰 Workshop: Getting Started with Cloud-Native Geospatial: Tools, Data, and Scalable Workflows\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#-workshop-getting-started-with-cloud-native-geospatial-tools-data-and-scalable-workflows\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “🧰 Workshop: Getting Started with Cloud-Native Geospatial: Tools, Data, and Scalable Workflows”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>🕚 12:30 - 1:00 pm CST\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Topics Covered:\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\u003Cli>What cloud-native geospatial means, why it matters, and how it improves data access\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to work with modern formats like GeoParquet and Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs using tools like QGIS and Python\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to access and explore data with Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to scale your spatial analysis using distributed computing tools like Apache Sedona\u003C/li>\u003C/ul> \n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Resources Mentioned:\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cnl>\u003C/nl>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/?.language=en\">STAC Browser\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis_plugin_gpq_downloader/\">QGIS GeoParquet Downloader\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/\">CNG Guide\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://cloud.wherobots.com/auth/register\">Wherobots Community Account Sign Up\u003C/a> (specific notebook: /examples/Getting_Started folder once you sign up)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bio: Matt Forrest\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Matt Forrest is a geospatial professional focused on education and scaling technology.

Beavers slow and store water in their ponds, canals, and the surrounding soil during flood events, which can then be accessed by riparian vegetation during droughts. As a result, the well-watered vegetation in beaver-dammed riparian corridors is less flammable during wildfires.

The development of maps has been fundamentally driven by the fear of the unknown and the creative impulse to manifest new worlds. Early cartography arose from anxieties surrounding uncharted territories, dangerous coastlines, and imagined landscapes. This transformed fear into actionable spatial knowledge, with creativity serving as a tool to discover what lay beyond the horizon. Once territories were mapped, the fear of loss, distortion, or reduction of these mapped territories spurred further technological advancements, fueled by creative problem-solving. Creative maps, Artistic maps, and counter-mapping projects, born from creative reimagination, challenge dominant narratives and shape public discourse. This creative reinterpretation of maps can foreground marginalized perspectives, fostering empathy, critical engagement, and influencing public opinion. The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the world of maps, and its interplay with fear and creativity, remains a critical area of inquiry. Technology-led mapping remains an area of skepticism and fear due to the potential risks of data breach, algorithmic bias, and surveillance. This talk discusses the convergence of fear, creativity, and AI to explore a previously neglected perspective on the world of maps. By analyzing maps through the lens of fear and creativity, we can gain fresh insights and stimulate new ways of thinking about the role and significance of maps, which are essentially visual narratives of the known and unknown.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Conservation on a Slippery Slope: Using GIS and Remote Sensing to Predict and Prevent Land Degradation\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>👤 Ethan Bledsoe, Northwestern University\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Amidst Ecuador’s cloud forests, where conservation and development collide, soil erosion threatens biodiversity and local communities. Using ArcGIS Pro, Google Earth Engine (GEE), Python, and high-resolution remote sensing, I mapped erosion risks in Manduriacu, a region where steep slopes and land-use changes endanger fragile ecosystems. By integrating these outputs into the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), I quantified erosion risk through key factors: R-factor (rainfall erosivity), K-factor (soil erodibility), LS-factor (slope steepness and length), C-factor (land cover), and P-factor (conservation practices). My analysis pinpointed severe soil loss near roads, deforested areas, and the Manduriacu Hydroelectric Dam, where infrastructure has destabilized surrounding slopes. By overlaying my results with hydrological flow accumulation models, I identified sediment transport pathways threatening local waterways. Field validation with conservation rangers confirmed exposed root systems and degraded slopes in high-risk zones, strengthening the model’s predictive accuracy. To enhance this analysis, I used GEE’s cloud-based processing to automate NDVI classification, linking vegetation loss trends to topographic and hydrological factors. Leveraging Sentinel-2 imagery, I conducted NDVI time-series modeling, applying linear, spline, and moving average interpolation to detect vegetation loss patterns over time. These insights directly informed Fundación Ecominga’s reforestation priorities by pinpointing degraded areas most in need of intervention, optimizing efforts to stabilize slopes and restore biodiversity. In this talk, I’ll explore how geospatial analysis transforms conservation planning — demonstrating how satellite-driven NDVI forecasting, cloud computing, and erosion modeling can bridge the gap between remote sensing and on-the-ground reforestation strategies to protect Ecuador’s cloud forests.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Teaching about Communities: Integrating Open Geospatial and Map Resources into Projects\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>👤 Tara Anthony, Penn State University\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This session will highlight course activities, instructional initiatives, and library engagement activities focused on community projects using open government geospatial, maps, and GIS resources.

Ecological and genomic attributes of populations can provide two orthologous perspectives on the biological profiles associated with conservation challenges. Together, GIS and modern genomics help identify the environmental and genomic conditions that should maximize fitness and thus population productivity. Here, I illustrate representative approaches to combine GIS and population genomics. I first introduce recent approaches that combine modern genomics and ecological niche modeling to identify and conserve local adaptation profiles. I then introduce the idea of distilling genomic information into thematic GIS layers. This integration of genomics into GIS thematic layers will help convey the implications from genomic datasets to nonspecialists to help better inform applied conservation management and associated policy. I provide several examples relevant for conservation, including my own research, that illustrate how this integration of GIS + modern population genomics could be realized.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Developing the Washington State Food Rescue Map\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>👤 Mariah Rubin, University of Washington\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Food insecurity and food waste are persistent challenges in Washington state. Over 2 million residents face food insecurity, while more than 1 million tons of food waste—including 390,000 tons of edible food—are generated annually (Use Food Well Washington Plan, 2022). Food rescue presents a solution to reduce food waste and improve food security. In 2015, the Washington state legislature set a goal to cut edible food waste by 50% by 2030, tasking the Department of Ecology (DOE) with tracking progress. However, scattered data and limited tools have hindered these efforts.   Our University of Washington team developed the Washington State Food Rescue Map with the best available data to support DOE’s mandate to collect and monitor food waste reduction efforts, identify data gaps, and support opportunities for preventing food waste through food rescue. Our team leveraged the expertise of hunger relief organizations across Washington by conducting a survey and in-depth interviews. This provided insights for assessing their current food rescue practices and capacity to accept food donations, identifying barriers and opportunities for improving and expanding food rescue, validating the map’s data layers, and understanding how the map could rescue more food. The findings and mapping products from this project will equip decision-makers with the tools to make data-informed decisions that will reduce the distance that excess food travels to increase food safety, reduce carbon emissions from transportation, and address food security gaps in overburdened and underserved communities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Identifying Car Locations and State Using Deep Learning\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>👤 SM Ahsanullah, The Ohio State University\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Urban vehicle detection and classification remain critical for traffic management, urban planning, and smart city initiatives. This research explores the use of ArcGIS Pro’s deep-learning models to analyze high-resolution satellite imagery, aiming to identify vehicles and classify them as either moving or parked. By leveraging existing pre-trained models and retraining them with supervised data from the target urban area, we achieve a workflow tailored to the city’s unique conditions. Georeferenced satellite imagery with an inherent coordinate system ensures that each detected vehicle’s location is accurately mapped, streamlining the process of spatial analysis.  To distinguish moving from parked vehicles, spatial context plays a pivotal role. Parking lot boundaries and street parking zones are integrated into the analysis, allowing vehicles detected within these areas to be classified as stationary. In contrast, vehicles in known travel lanes or away from parking zones are more likely to be moving. The research demonstrates how geospatial features combined with deep learning output can produce reliable vehicle state classifications, without the need for time-sequenced imagery.  This method represents a scalable, efficient approach to urban vehicle monitoring, contributing valuable insights for urban planners and transportation managers. It highlights how off-the-shelf deep-learning capabilities, enhanced with domain-specific training data, can be applied to solve real-world challenges. The results lay the foundation for more sophisticated analyses, such as traffic flow optimization and parking demand prediction, supporting smarter, more responsive cities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"session-3-gis-for-equity-and-engagement\">Session 3: GIS for Equity and Engagement\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#session-3-gis-for-equity-and-engagement\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Session 3: GIS for Equity and Engagement”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>🕚 3:00 - 4:00 CST\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Facilitator: Karen Majewicz, University of Minnesota; Slide Operator: Sue Oldenburg, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"presentation-1-map-making-fostering-gis-and-makerspace-inquiry-through-a-collaborative-data-physicalization-project-at-a-liberal-arts-college\">Presentation 1: Map Making: Fostering GIS and Makerspace Inquiry through a Collaborative Data Physicalization Project at a Liberal Arts College\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#presentation-1-map-making-fostering-gis-and-makerspace-inquiry-through-a-collaborative-data-physicalization-project-at-a-liberal-arts-college\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Presentation 1: Map Making: Fostering GIS and Makerspace Inquiry through a Collaborative Data Physicalization Project at a Liberal Arts College”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>👤 Tracy Tien, Wellesley College; Additional authors: Allegra Dufresne, Wellesley College; Johanna Okerlund, Wellesley College\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We conducted a multi-year initiative to engage the Wellesley College community with interdisciplinary GIS and making methods through a participatory data physicalization activity that transformed a library hallway wall into a large-scale map.

With over 200,000 print maps, including government maps provided through the Federal Depository Library Program, the collection is an important repository of print geographic materials that serves millions of people. However, the collection’s size and complexity, which has prevented the creation of a comprehensive catalog of every individual item, makes it daunting for users to explore and find materials. To tackle this problem, the library’s GIS and Data Services team created a 3D model of McKeldin’s map collection using ArcGIS Pro and extensive field measurements.

He has a PhD in History from the University of California, Berkeley, an MA in American Studies from the Universität Heidelberg, and a BA in History and Economics from Columbia University. He was a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows before coming to the University of Cambridge.\n\nDr. Lee's research focuses on North American colonization, mostly in the nineteenth century. He is currently writing a history of US expansion by Indian treaty, using an approach that combines archival digging with spatial analysis in GIS. The book focuses on an important but obscure institution—the St. Louis Superintendency—whose administration of the Indian treaty line influenced a string of well-known events, from the Lewis and Clark expedition to Bleeding Kansas. By restoring those connections, the project illuminates how dispossession by treaty shaped the development of the United States. An article growing out of this study, “Accounting for Conquest: The Price of the Louisiana Purchase of Indian Country,” appeared in The Journal of American History, and received awards from the Organization of American Historians, the Western History Association, and the Society for History in the Federal Government. That piece also forms the first in a series of articles Dr. Lee is working on that use GIS to revisit longstanding questions about the territorial and demographic history of the American West. The latest of these projects, “Land-Grab Universities,” detailed how Indigenous land funded land-grant colleges across the United States. Interactive maps and data from that project can be explored at [landgrabu.org](https://landgrabu.org).\n\n**American Domesday**\n\nIn this talk, Dr. Lee will discuss how increasingly accessible desktop GIS tools are poised to reinvigorate the study of the US public domain, a once thriving area of study that has lain mostly fallow for a generation. He will describe the possibilities opening up from spatial data at the Bureau of Land Management and his own work developing tools to visualize the legal transformation of roughly a billion acres of the American West from the 18th c. to the present. Land patent data, he will suggest, can open up new pathways to ask questions about gender, ethnicity, demography, and perhaps most of all, the unresolved legacy of Indigenous dispossession in the United States. There will be maps.\n\n### Break\n\n:material-clock-time-nine-outline: 10:00 - 10:20 CST / 11:00 - 11:20 EST\n\n### Session 1: Flora and Fauna\n\n:material-clock-time-nine-outline: 10:20 - 12:00 CST / 11:20 - 1:00 EST\n\n*Facilitator: Laura Kane McElfresh, University of Minnesota*\n\n\n#### The Indiana Roadkill Display: The Role of Civic Science in GIS\n\n*Cooper D Sykes, Indiana University*\n\nWith the development of the automobile and its rapid influence on American life, more and more wildlife have been killed in wildlife-vehicle collisions. To gather more information about roadkill and the effect of roads on ecosystems and biodiversity, civic science has been increasingly used. Civic science is defined as employing the general public to collect and report data on critical scientific problems. Civic science projects include everyone from science newcomers to retired researchers, teachers, students, etc. In this project, our research question was to determine if civic science could provide relevant data regarding Indiana’s roadkill. To create the Indiana Roadkill Display, it was a necessity to both develop a usable ArcGIS web application and generate enough interest from the Indiana GIS community to have a reasonable amount of data input. By utilizing ArcGIS' Web App Builder and reaching out to various groups, including the Indiana Nature Facebook group, we were able to create a civic science project that had roadkill data from across the state. 135 sightings of roadkill were reported in just the first five months of the application. Unfortunately, due to various limitations, the Indiana Roadkill Display was not able to generate ground-breaking conclusions about where and what species are being killed in wildlife-vehicle collisions in Indiana, but it did suggest that civic science research at Indiana University or elsewhere in Indiana should be a focal point in research discussions going forward. The role of civic science in GIS is poised to expand greatly in the years ahead.\n\n#### Statewide canopy height model generation using  USGS 3DEP LiDAR data in Indiana, USA\n\n**Sungchan Oh, Purdue University**\n\nWe propose a canopy height mapping workflow with 3DEP LiDAR across the state of Indiana, USA. To address the issue related to large data size and data processing requirements of 3DEP data, we proposed a systematic CHM generation framework to produce countywide and statewide CHMs in an efficient manner. We created different spatial resolution CHM model to address the issue of height accuracy and data omission, and we used field estimated height data to test CHM accuracy. The resulted CHMs could be widely applied in the management of timber, fiber, wildlife, and many other ecosystem services. \n\n#### Modeling the potential for Greater Prairie-Chicken Reintroduction to an Indiana Tallgrass Prairie\n\n**Zach T Finn, Purdue University**\n\nGreater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus; GPC) have declined throughout large areas in the eastern portion of their range. We used species distribution modeling to predict most appropriate areas of translocation of GPC in and around Kankakee Sands (KS), a tallgrass prairie in northwest Indiana, USA. We used MaxEnt for modelling the predictions based on relevant environmental predictors along with occurrence points of 54 known lek sites. We created four models inspired by Hovick et al. (2015): Universal, Environmental, Anthropogenic-Landcover, and Anthropogenic-MODIS. The Universal, Environmental, and Anthropogenic-MODIS models possessed passable AUC scores with low omission error rates. However, only the Universal model performed better than the null model according to binomial testing. We created maps of all models with passing AUC scores along with an overlay map displaying the highest predictions across all passing models. MaxEnt predicted high relative likelihoods of occurrence for the entirety of KS and many areas in the nearby landscape, including the surrounding agricultural matrix. With implications of some management suggestions and potential cooperation with local farmers, GPC translocation to the area appears plausible. \n\n#### Forest Structural Heterogeneity as a Predictor of Wildlife Occupancy and Richness\n\n**Jessica M Elliott, Purdue University**\n\nIn recent decades, wildlife habitat studies have begun to incorporate more structural characteristics, such as mean maximum canopy height, canopy and understory vegetative cover, and vertical heterogeneity measures. However, most still collect habitat data primarily from field measurements, which are limited in spatial extent and force researchers to extrapolate from small-scale, ground-based measures. LiDAR offers the opportunity to objectively and quantitatively measure habitat features across landscape level extents. We mapped and measured forest canopy structural diversity at ~ 100 plots across Indiana at a series of 3 (25m, 50m, 100m) radii to explore landscape heterogeneity across space, utilizing new aerial LiDAR in tandem with GIS mapping software and wildlife camera trap data. Our aim is to quantify the relationship between occupancy of commonly occurring midwestern wildlife species and forest structural diversity, specifically examining the ties between species groups and habitat features.\n\n### Session 2: Built Environment\n\n*Facilitator: Yue Shirley Li, Purdue University*\n\n#### Indoor Mapping of University of Maryland Library Physical Resources\n \n**Milan Budhathoki, University of Maryland**\n\nMcKeldin Library is the main branch library of the University of Maryland Libraries. McKeldin Library is one of the largest buildings on campus consisting of seven floors and a basement. The library has more than 2400 stacks and more than 2 millions of print collections. McKeldin Library also serves as a regional Federal depository library, housing the U.S. Government Information, Maps & GIS Services collection. It is quite daunting for a patron to find the particular book stack/call-numbers or any other physical assets (i.e., study room, computer lab, digital support, restrooms). The library has undertaken a GIS based solution (ArcGIS Indoor) to develop a mobile application (Wayfinding) to help the patrons to find topics of their interest and route to the destination(s). A mobile survey application was used to collect and validate the library assets as points of interest including stacks location. In this presentation, I will briefly highlight the project status update. \n\n\n#### Using Drones For Facility Assessments On Campuses\n\n**Jon P Schwichtenberg, GRAEF**\n\nThis presentation will show how we are using drones to accurately compile GIS and asset management data on facades and roofs of buildings. The technology allows engineers to quickly and accurately assess water issues, heat loss, facade deterioration and roof issues. The data is then logged into long term tracking asset management systems.\n\n#### Low Cost Connected Work Zone Devices with Simplified Architecture\n\n**Glenn Vorhes, University of Wisconsin**\n\nConnected work zone devices for safety, traffic monitoring, and performance evaluation are important assets in road construction projects.  Challenges for implementation and connectivity present a barrier to their implementation and full realization of benefits.  Typical connected work zone devices require dedicated cellular modems with monthly data charges for each device.  The numerous connections or proprietary platforms hinder integration with a central advanced traffic management system.  The described architecture presents considerable cost, data ownership, and security concerns.  This paper presents an alternative architecture wherein many inexpensive monitoring and incident detection devices read and process sensor data and communicate pertinent information by radio link to a single internet connected hub that forwards information to a central server.  The server then notifies client applications that support work zone monitoring and incident response.  From a field test of the radio units in an active work zone, the effective transmission range was found to be 3 km.  All devices in a work zone up to 6 km in length could be serviced by a single internet connected base receiver station centered within it.  Prototype devices were created using readily and inexpensively available sensors for microcontrollers.  An example dashboard was created to show real time work zone device and sensor information on a mapping interface.  This project shows how use of connected work zone devices can be expanded at low costs using commonly available hardware and skills with a simplified architecture and encapsulated complexity from the standpoint of work zone management personnel while retaining data ownership.\n\n### Lunch Break\n\n:material-clock-time-nine-outline: 12:00 - 1:00 CST / 1:00 - 2:00 EST\n\n\n### Keynote Address by Dr. Tracy Kugler\n\n:material-clock-time-nine-outline: 1:00 - 2:00 CST / 2:00 - 3:00 EST\n\n*Facilitator: Melinda Kernik, University of Minnesota*\n\n**Bio**: Dr. Tracy Kugler joined the Minnesota Population Center at the University of Minnesota in 2011 as the Project Manager for Terra Populus (now IPUMS Terra). She now works across all of the aggregate-spatial IPUMS products: Terra, NHGIS, GeoMarker, and managing their newest product, IHGIS (International Historical Geographic Information System), which includes aggregate data from population and agricultural censuses around the world.\n\nDr. Kugler's educational background includes a B.A. in Theater Arts (Stage Management), B.S. and M.S. in Systems Engineering (Systems Modeling and Analysis), and PhD in Geography (GIS and Ecosystem Informatics). The unifying thread that runs through these disparate degrees is an interest in the big picture and how all the pieces of a system fit together and interact with each other. At the MPC, she leverages those skills to develop workflows and processes to bring different types of data together. She has developed workflows for boundary processing that meet requirements for confidentiality and harmonization over time, while providing the greatest possible level of geographic detail. She has also developed workflows for documenting and manipulating highly heterogeneous published census tables to conform to a standard data and metadata structure.\n\n**The Population Data Buffet: Choosing the right data for your project**\nDr. Kugler will discuss three different classes of population data: aggregate/place-level, individual-level microdata, and gridded population data. For each class of data, she will cover the advantages and disadvantages, the types of analysis it is best suited for, good places to get the data (focusing on IPUMS and the PopGrid Collaborative), and considerations for working with the data.\n\n### Break\n\n:material-clock-time-nine-outline: 2:00 - 2:15 CST / 3:00 - 3:15 EST\n\n\n### Lightning Talks\n\n:material-clock-time-nine-outline: 2:15 - 3:00 CST / 3:15 - 4:00 EST\n\n*Facilitator: Caroline Kayko, University of Michigan*\n\n#### 1. Mapping and Validating Indoor Physical Assets of University of Maryland Libraries using ArcGIS Field Map Application\n \n**Manal Zahed Al-Hajji, University of Maryland\n**\nMcKeldin library has only the floor plans in CAD format, with no illustrative maps to guide students and other users to the location of the various resources in each floor. This makes difficult for the user to find the needed book without guidance from an experienced staff. With 2 million volumes, it is spatially impossible sometimes to get to the right corner without delay. Using the shortest route analysis will encourage the student to use the library books and maps and the other assets. Also, McKeldin Library has many assets like printers, plotters, computers, etc. distributed at all floors without any spatial maps that identify their location and descriptions. Using the network analysis tools will help the maintenance staff to find the asset that need maintenance and they can manage the best route to maintain all the required assets.\nMost library users stay on the ground floor because of the large number of seating areas, which result in generating high density on this floor. The number of users decrease as you go to the upper floors. We are trying to ensure that the new Covid measurements are observed and the 6’ distance between users is maintained. Student density needs to be measured at each floor, and students need to be encouraged to disburse and use all floors to allow for larger number of users while still guaranteeing the desired distances among them.\n\n\n##### 2. Exploring Movement Data in Context with the DynamoVis Software for Research and Education\n\n**Crystal J Bae, The University of Chicago**\n\nWith the widespread availability of GPS tracking data of movement, increasingly collected at many spatial and temporal scales, there is unprecedented opportunity for expanding our spatial knowledge with regards to human and animal movement behavior. Understanding movement is critical to expanding theories in the spatial sciences and has important applications for fields including ecology, economics, transportation, and social interaction. This talk provides an overview of the open-source DynamoVis 1.0 software for the visualization of movement data and related environmental variables. The design of DynamoVis is based upon the cartographic framework for representing movement by Dodge (2020), which considers the representation of the cartographic space, the components of movement (object, location, time, attributes), visual variables for encoding movement, and interface considerations including display forms and interaction. DynamoVis allows scientists and educators to easily explore and represent complex movement data in a powerful visual interface, with additional considerations relating to the representation of dynamic phenomena and the related spatial context. This window into complex movement data enables intuitive data exploration, the use of visual variables to highlight patterns and spatial relationships, and hypothesis generation informed by visual analysis. Additionally, DynamoVis can be used as a communication tool for collaboration across disciplinary domains or as a teaching tool for scientific reasoning, as it allows built-in recording and export of dynamic visualizations of tracking data within the environmental context.\n\n##### 3. Using climate models to assess spatio-temporal crime behavior in cities\n\n**Jaemin Eun, University of Maryland**\n\nThe effects of regional and local climates and their interaction with human geographies in urban areas have been largely overlooked. For example, physical environmental variables such as temperatures (heat) in urban areas are linked with changing criminal behavior. In this study, we take a systematic approach to examine the relationship between changing temperatures and crime statistics at climate scales for the City of Chicago. Here, we compare temperature data from urban climate model outputs and publicly available crime datasets to identify census tracts sensitive to variations in temperature at daily and seasonal scales for over a 20-year period. The study also articulates the sensitivity of different types of crimes with a heat vulnerability index formulated using socioeconomic variables from the US census and health datasets from the CDC. Overall, the outcomes of the study can help law enforcement agencies, urban planners, and stakeholders to identify heat stress locations and devise heat mitigation solutions that can help in reducing violence and structured racism in statistically high-crime rate cities like Chicago.\n\n##### 4. Evaluating Visitation and Mobility Pattern Changes due to the Coronavirus Pandemic in Tippecanoe County\n\n**Dana M. Singh, Purdue University**\n\nMobility data can provide invaluable information about an area and can contribute to studies of city infrastructure, efficient transportation, and commute patterns. With the onset of the Coronavirus epidemic, travel restrictions and social distancing has greatly affected our day-to-day life. For example, businesses were heavily affected as less people traveled, and classrooms have been converted to remote learning to avoid gathering. This Mobility data can provide key insights as to how daily life has been changed. In this study, we focused on Tippecanoe County, Indiana, where the West Lafayette campus of Purdue University is located.  Visitation Patterns were evaluated and assessed for key differences pre-COVID, during COVID, up to the present year. Through the use of Safegraph data, we were able to identify Core places in Tippecanoe County and match them with visitation numbers in Monthly Pattern data. By analyzing this mobility data, we can evaluate the effect of COVID-19, such as its impact on surrounding businesses in different categories associated with socioeconomic factors and travel patterns. \n\n##### 5. Developing an ArcGIS Hub site: Example from Penn State University Libraries\n\n**Tara Anthony, Penn State University**\n\nThis talk will highlight the process of developing an ArcGIS Hub site for content created by current and former members of the Donald W. Hamer Center for Maps and Geospatial Information at Penn State University Libraries. This talk will describe elements of the ArcGIS Hub site included in their current site and factors that contributed to its design. This ArcGIS Hub site includes content created from digital maps from the Penn State Libraries collection, along with multiple types of ArcGIS Online applications, and StoryMaps created to showcase map content and connect content to additional resources, media, and descriptive resources.

He has a PhD in History from the University of California, Berkeley, an MA in American Studies from the Universität Heidelberg, and a BA in History and Economics from Columbia University. He was a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows before coming to the University of Cambridge.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dr. Lee’s research focuses on North American colonization, mostly in the nineteenth century. He is currently writing a history of US expansion by Indian treaty, using an approach that combines archival digging with spatial analysis in GIS. The book focuses on an important but obscure institution—the St. Louis Superintendency—whose administration of the Indian treaty line influenced a string of well-known events, from the Lewis and Clark expedition to Bleeding Kansas. By restoring those connections, the project illuminates how dispossession by treaty shaped the development of the United States. An article growing out of this study, “Accounting for Conquest: The Price of the Louisiana Purchase of Indian Country,” appeared in The Journal of American History, and received awards from the Organization of American Historians, the Western History Association, and the Society for History in the Federal Government. That piece also forms the first in a series of articles Dr. Lee is working on that use GIS to revisit longstanding questions about the territorial and demographic history of the American West. The latest of these projects, “Land-Grab Universities,” detailed how Indigenous land funded land-grant colleges across the United States. Interactive maps and data from that project can be explored at \u003Ca href=\"https://landgrabu.org\">landgrabu.org\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>American Domesday\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In this talk, Dr. Lee will discuss how increasingly accessible desktop GIS tools are poised to reinvigorate the study of the US public domain, a once thriving area of study that has lain mostly fallow for a generation. He will describe the possibilities opening up from spatial data at the Bureau of Land Management and his own work developing tools to visualize the legal transformation of roughly a billion acres of the American West from the 18th c. to the present. Land patent data, he will suggest, can open up new pathways to ask questions about gender, ethnicity, demography, and perhaps most of all, the unresolved legacy of Indigenous dispossession in the United States. There will be maps.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"break\">Break\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#break\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Break”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>:material-clock-time-nine-outline: 10:00 - 10:20 CST / 11:00 - 11:20 EST\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"session-1-flora-and-fauna\">Session 1: Flora and Fauna\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#session-1-flora-and-fauna\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Session 1: Flora and Fauna”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>:material-clock-time-nine-outline: 10:20 - 12:00 CST / 11:20 - 1:00 EST\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Facilitator: Laura Kane McElfresh, University of Minnesota\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"the-indiana-roadkill-display-the-role-of-civic-science-in-gis\">The Indiana Roadkill Display: The Role of Civic Science in GIS\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#the-indiana-roadkill-display-the-role-of-civic-science-in-gis\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “The Indiana Roadkill Display: The Role of Civic Science in GIS”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Cooper D Sykes, Indiana University\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With the development of the automobile and its rapid influence on American life, more and more wildlife have been killed in wildlife-vehicle collisions. To gather more information about roadkill and the effect of roads on ecosystems and biodiversity, civic science has been increasingly used. Civic science is defined as employing the general public to collect and report data on critical scientific problems. Civic science projects include everyone from science newcomers to retired researchers, teachers, students, etc. In this project, our research question was to determine if civic science could provide relevant data regarding Indiana’s roadkill. To create the Indiana Roadkill Display, it was a necessity to both develop a usable ArcGIS web application and generate enough interest from the Indiana GIS community to have a reasonable amount of data input. By utilizing ArcGIS’ Web App Builder and reaching out to various groups, including the Indiana Nature Facebook group, we were able to create a civic science project that had roadkill data from across the state. 135 sightings of roadkill were reported in just the first five months of the application. Unfortunately, due to various limitations, the Indiana Roadkill Display was not able to generate ground-breaking conclusions about where and what species are being killed in wildlife-vehicle collisions in Indiana, but it did suggest that civic science research at Indiana University or elsewhere in Indiana should be a focal point in research discussions going forward. The role of civic science in GIS is poised to expand greatly in the years ahead.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"statewide-canopy-height-model-generation-using--usgs-3dep-lidar-data-in-indiana-usa\">Statewide canopy height model generation using  USGS 3DEP LiDAR data in Indiana, USA\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#statewide-canopy-height-model-generation-using--usgs-3dep-lidar-data-in-indiana-usa\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Statewide canopy height model generation using  USGS 3DEP LiDAR data in Indiana, USA”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Sungchan Oh, Purdue University\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We propose a canopy height mapping workflow with 3DEP LiDAR across the state of Indiana, USA.

We created different spatial resolution CHM model to address the issue of height accuracy and data omission, and we used field estimated height data to test CHM accuracy. The resulted CHMs could be widely applied in the management of timber, fiber, wildlife, and many other ecosystem services.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"modeling-the-potential-for-greater-prairie-chicken-reintroduction-to-an-indiana-tallgrass-prairie\">Modeling the potential for Greater Prairie-Chicken Reintroduction to an Indiana Tallgrass Prairie\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#modeling-the-potential-for-greater-prairie-chicken-reintroduction-to-an-indiana-tallgrass-prairie\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Modeling the potential for Greater Prairie-Chicken Reintroduction to an Indiana Tallgrass Prairie”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Zach T Finn, Purdue University\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus; GPC) have declined throughout large areas in the eastern portion of their range. We used species distribution modeling to predict most appropriate areas of translocation of GPC in and around Kankakee Sands (KS), a tallgrass prairie in northwest Indiana, USA. We used MaxEnt for modelling the predictions based on relevant environmental predictors along with occurrence points of 54 known lek sites. We created four models inspired by Hovick et al. (2015): Universal, Environmental, Anthropogenic-Landcover, and Anthropogenic-MODIS. The Universal, Environmental, and Anthropogenic-MODIS models possessed passable AUC scores with low omission error rates. However, only the Universal model performed better than the null model according to binomial testing. We created maps of all models with passing AUC scores along with an overlay map displaying the highest predictions across all passing models. MaxEnt predicted high relative likelihoods of occurrence for the entirety of KS and many areas in the nearby landscape, including the surrounding agricultural matrix. With implications of some management suggestions and potential cooperation with local farmers, GPC translocation to the area appears plausible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"forest-structural-heterogeneity-as-a-predictor-of-wildlife-occupancy-and-richness\">Forest Structural Heterogeneity as a Predictor of Wildlife Occupancy and Richness\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#forest-structural-heterogeneity-as-a-predictor-of-wildlife-occupancy-and-richness\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Forest Structural Heterogeneity as a Predictor of Wildlife Occupancy and Richness”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jessica M Elliott, Purdue University\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In recent decades, wildlife habitat studies have begun to incorporate more structural characteristics, such as mean maximum canopy height, canopy and understory vegetative cover, and vertical heterogeneity measures. However, most still collect habitat data primarily from field measurements, which are limited in spatial extent and force researchers to extrapolate from small-scale, ground-based measures. LiDAR offers the opportunity to objectively and quantitatively measure habitat features across landscape level extents. We mapped and measured forest canopy structural diversity at ~ 100 plots across Indiana at a series of 3 (25m, 50m, 100m) radii to explore landscape heterogeneity across space, utilizing new aerial LiDAR in tandem with GIS mapping software and wildlife camera trap data. Our aim is to quantify the relationship between occupancy of commonly occurring midwestern wildlife species and forest structural diversity, specifically examining the ties between species groups and habitat features.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"session-2-built-environment\">Session 2: Built Environment\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#session-2-built-environment\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Session 2: Built Environment”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Facilitator: Yue Shirley Li, Purdue University\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"indoor-mapping-of-university-of-maryland-library-physical-resources\">Indoor Mapping of University of Maryland Library Physical Resources\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#indoor-mapping-of-university-of-maryland-library-physical-resources\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Indoor Mapping of University of Maryland Library Physical Resources”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Milan Budhathoki, University of Maryland\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>McKeldin Library is the main branch library of the University of Maryland Libraries.

Challenges for implementation and connectivity present a barrier to their implementation and full realization of benefits.  Typical connected work zone devices require dedicated cellular modems with monthly data charges for each device.  The numerous connections or proprietary platforms hinder integration with a central advanced traffic management system.  The described architecture presents considerable cost, data ownership, and security concerns.  This paper presents an alternative architecture wherein many inexpensive monitoring and incident detection devices read and process sensor data and communicate pertinent information by radio link to a single internet connected hub that forwards information to a central server.  The server then notifies client applications that support work zone monitoring and incident response.  From a field test of the radio units in an active work zone, the effective transmission range was found to be 3 km.  All devices in a work zone up to 6 km in length could be serviced by a single internet connected base receiver station centered within it.  Prototype devices were created using readily and inexpensively available sensors for microcontrollers.  An example dashboard was created to show real time work zone device and sensor information on a mapping interface.  This project shows how use of connected work zone devices can be expanded at low costs using commonly available hardware and skills with a simplified architecture and encapsulated complexity from the standpoint of work zone management personnel while retaining data ownership.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"lunch-break\">Lunch Break\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#lunch-break\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Lunch Break”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>:material-clock-time-nine-outline: 12:00 - 1:00 CST / 1:00 - 2:00 EST\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"keynote-address-by-dr-tracy-kugler\">Keynote Address by Dr. Tracy Kugler\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#keynote-address-by-dr-tracy-kugler\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Keynote Address by Dr. Tracy Kugler”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>:material-clock-time-nine-outline: 1:00 - 2:00 CST / 2:00 - 3:00 EST\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Facilitator: Melinda Kernik, University of Minnesota\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bio\u003C/strong>: Dr. Tracy Kugler joined the Minnesota Population Center at the University of Minnesota in 2011 as the Project Manager for Terra Populus (now IPUMS Terra).

This makes difficult for the user to find the needed book without guidance from an experienced staff. With 2 million volumes, it is spatially impossible sometimes to get to the right corner without delay. Using the shortest route analysis will encourage the student to use the library books and maps and the other assets. Also, McKeldin Library has many assets like printers, plotters, computers, etc. distributed at all floors without any spatial maps that identify their location and descriptions. Using the network analysis tools will help the maintenance staff to find the asset that need maintenance and they can manage the best route to maintain all the required assets.\nMost library users stay on the ground floor because of the large number of seating areas, which result in generating high density on this floor. The number of users decrease as you go to the upper floors. We are trying to ensure that the new Covid measurements are observed and the 6’ distance between users is maintained. Student density needs to be measured at each floor, and students need to be encouraged to disburse and use all floors to allow for larger number of users while still guaranteeing the desired distances among them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h5\">\u003Ch5 id=\"2-exploring-movement-data-in-context-with-the-dynamovis-software-for-research-and-education\">2.

Understanding movement is critical to expanding theories in the spatial sciences and has important applications for fields including ecology, economics, transportation, and social interaction. This talk provides an overview of the open-source DynamoVis 1.0 software for the visualization of movement data and related environmental variables. The design of DynamoVis is based upon the cartographic framework for representing movement by Dodge (2020), which considers the representation of the cartographic space, the components of movement (object, location, time, attributes), visual variables for encoding movement, and interface considerations including display forms and interaction. DynamoVis allows scientists and educators to easily explore and represent complex movement data in a powerful visual interface, with additional considerations relating to the representation of dynamic phenomena and the related spatial context. This window into complex movement data enables intuitive data exploration, the use of visual variables to highlight patterns and spatial relationships, and hypothesis generation informed by visual analysis. Additionally, DynamoVis can be used as a communication tool for collaboration across disciplinary domains or as a teaching tool for scientific reasoning, as it allows built-in recording and export of dynamic visualizations of tracking data within the environmental context.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h5\">\u003Ch5 id=\"3-using-climate-models-to-assess-spatio-temporal-crime-behavior-in-cities\">3.

For example, physical environmental variables such as temperatures (heat) in urban areas are linked with changing criminal behavior. In this study, we take a systematic approach to examine the relationship between changing temperatures and crime statistics at climate scales for the City of Chicago. Here, we compare temperature data from urban climate model outputs and publicly available crime datasets to identify census tracts sensitive to variations in temperature at daily and seasonal scales for over a 20-year period. The study also articulates the sensitivity of different types of crimes with a heat vulnerability index formulated using socioeconomic variables from the US census and health datasets from the CDC. Overall, the outcomes of the study can help law enforcement agencies, urban planners, and stakeholders to identify heat stress locations and devise heat mitigation solutions that can help in reducing violence and structured racism in statistically high-crime rate cities like Chicago.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h5\">\u003Ch5 id=\"4-evaluating-visitation-and-mobility-pattern-changes-due-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic-in-tippecanoe-county\">4.

With the onset of the Coronavirus epidemic, travel restrictions and social distancing has greatly affected our day-to-day life. For example, businesses were heavily affected as less people traveled, and classrooms have been converted to remote learning to avoid gathering. This Mobility data can provide key insights as to how daily life has been changed. In this study, we focused on Tippecanoe County, Indiana, where the West Lafayette campus of Purdue University is located.  Visitation Patterns were evaluated and assessed for key differences pre-COVID, during COVID, up to the present year. Through the use of Safegraph data, we were able to identify Core places in Tippecanoe County and match them with visitation numbers in Monthly Pattern data. By analyzing this mobility data, we can evaluate the effect of COVID-19, such as its impact on surrounding businesses in different categories associated with socioeconomic factors and travel patterns.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h5\">\u003Ch5 id=\"5-developing-an-arcgis-hub-site-example-from-penn-state-university-libraries\">5.

Using the results of a computer vision pipeline to understand past places at scale comes with new challenges and opportunities. The Machines Reading Maps project has worked with partners at the Library of Congress, the National Library of Scotland, the British Library, and also the David Rumsey Map Collection to create datasets of the text on large collections of digitized maps. This talk explores the results of the Machines Reading Maps project to date including our work in progress to, on the one hand, visualize and analyze the results for historical research, and, on the other, use text on maps data to improve map collection discovery.\n\n**Bio**\n\nKatie McDonough is a Lecturer in Digital Humanities at Lancaster University, and recently a member of Living with Machines and UK PI of Machines Reading Maps. She works at the intersection of social and intellectual history and the history of science and technology. She uses computational methods to translate large collections of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European texts and images, maps in particular, into data that historians can interpret. Her current projects explore Enlightenment discourses of geographic knowledge, the politics of highway construction in rural France, and the impact of railway infrastructure on nineteenth-century British communities. At The Alan Turing Institute, she chairs the Computer Vision for Digital Heritage Special Interest Group.\n\n--------\n\n### Presentations 1: Forests and Water\n\n10:20 - 11:20 CST / 11:20 - 12:20 EST\n\nFacilitator: Laura McElfresh, University of Minnesota\n\nSlide operator: Sue Oldenburg, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey\n\n#### Identifying potential locations for water quality wetland installation using GIS modeling\n\nAnnina Rupe, Ducks Unlimited\n\nIowa’s water quality has suffered due in part to the intense agriculture performed across the state. Wetlands naturally filter water which helps remove excess nutrients, but a majority of Iowa’s historic wetlands have been drained. Ducks Unlimited (DU) and the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) have partnered to identify where wetlands, specifically those aimed at improving water quality, would be best placed and to work with landowners to install these wetlands. This presentation delves into how GIS is used to simplify and speed up this process for the benefit of Iowans.\n\n---\n\n#### Plaintain Agroforestry in Uganda: Integrating Cultural Legacy into Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis\n\nJoshua Russell, Penn State University \n\nThe assurance of food security and a decent livelihood for smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa is an ever-increasing challenge. Agroforestry is seen as one solution that has been promoted by numerous agencies and organizations to improve food and livelihood security without undue negative impacts on the environment. While this technology exists in many forms and has been practiced in specific locations across Africa for generations, the widespread adoption and \"up-scaling\" of agroforestry requires consideration of whether the agroforestry planting scheme and key specie(s) included within that scheme are not only suitable for a given ecosystem but also if cultural practices/traditions in an area will favor up-take. GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is an effective tool for structuring and evaluating criteria for decision support, through there is a noted absence in current literature illustrating the integration of cultural legacy or indigenous knowledge into MCDA, particularly in settings where field survey of individuals or societies is not an option. In such a case, the implementation of a methodological framework for gleaning cultural legacy or indigenous knowledge from ethnographic works and other pertinent research is critical for developing an output of suitability that is culturally appropriate. This project is structured to illustrate how topological, ecological, and cultural criteria can be integrated in GIS-MCDA for the assessment of plantain-based agroforestry site suitability in Uganda. By accounting for cultural criteria in MCDA suitability analysis and identifying sites where cultural traditions favor a given intervention, the potential for up-take of promoted interventions is likely to be improved. \n\n---\n\n#### New Jersey State Regulatory Riparian Zone Map\n\nKate Douthat, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey; Larry Torok, New Jersey DEP\n\nThis map shows the locations and widths of regulatory riparian zones of the streams of New Jersey according to the Flood Hazard Area Control Act (FHA) Rules (N.J.A.C 7:13-4.1). The FHA designates riparian zones around streams, inside of which development and land disturbance is limited in order to protect target species, habitat, and water quality. The width and upstream extent of the buffer is based on state Surface Water Quality Standards and the location of habitat for endangered and threatened species. The State has a map of surface water quality standards that classifies streams by their type, designated uses, and anti-degradation statuses, but until now, the location of corresponding protective riparian zones was not mapped. Riparian zones had to be interpreted directly from the text of the rules—a complicated task for most users.  Some technical issues we encountered when making this map included reconciling different sets of stream centerlines and creating isodistances with ESRI’s new Trace Network tool. Other challenges included reconciling data definitions and regulatory definitions. The final map is not able to fully translate the rules into GIS due the limitations of the current data, e.g. the location of the top of bank of streams, which is a fine-scale topographic feature that must be identified in the field. However, this map provides the public with a new understanding of the location of riparian zones and stream protections at specific areas of interest as well as landscape-level patterns. \n\n---\n\n### LUNCH / COFFEE BREAK\n\n11:20 - 11:50 CST / 12:20 - 12:50 EST\n\n---\n\n### Lightning Talks A\n\n11:50 - 12:40 CST / 12:50 - 1:40 EST - \n\n*Facilitator: Karen Majewicz, University of Minnesota; Slide Operator: Nicole Scholtz, University of Michigan*\n\n1. **There and Back Again: An Analysis of the Movement of Avian Specimens Through Time and Space**\n\n    Summer Mengarelli and Brian Weeks, University of  Michigan;Shane DuBay, University of Texas-Arlington\n    \n    Avian specimens, like other biological specimens housed in natural history museums and herbaria throughout the world, are useful sources of data in wide-ranging topics including environmental and ecological issues, species distribution and abundance, morphology, biomimicry, and phenology. The origins of avian specimen collection coincide with the beginnings of colonialism, and while specimens collected in centuries past retain their utility in modern research, they also retain a complicated history. This project analyzes the movement of these specimens through space in order to understand how specimen collection is situated or complicated in the ongoing legacy of colonial science. Using georeferenced specimen records from natural history collections in North America and Europe, we investigate clusters of specimen movement through history and ask whether the distance between collection and storage has lengthened or shortened. We apply our results to a discussion of whether specimen collection’s role in colonial science has faded, and pose the question of what repatriation might look like in the context of natural history museums. This geospatial analysis of the history of avian specimen collection can act as a starting place for broader exploration into the impact of colonialism in the practices of natural history knowledge work.\n    \n    ---\n\n\n2. **Analyzing Seasonal Crime Trends in Chicago: Examining the Impact of Temperature and Geography on Public Safety**\n    \n    Abhimanyu Hans and Milan Budhathoki, University of Maryland\n    \n    This study investigates the seasonal trend of crime rates in the City of Chicago over a 20-year period. Daily crime location data were categorized into several crime types based on the classification code developed by law enforcement agencies, then spatially aggregated at the census tract level to examine spatial and temporal correlations. The study tested the hypothesis that certain crimes increase with warmer temperatures while others rise with colder temperatures, and that higher temperatures predict higher crime overall. Urban climate data from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and public crime data will be compared to identify census tracts sensitive to seasonal temperature changes. The findings aim to help law enforcement, urban planners, and stakeholders locate areas susceptible to heat stress and develop interventions to reduce violence and structural racism in highly crime-prone neighborhoods. This novel investigation of the overlooked links between climate, geography, and crime can inform strategies to mitigate urban heat impacts on public safety.\n    \n    ---\n\n3. **Mapping Heat Vulnerability in Indiana**\n    \n    Yuri Kim; Adriana Abreu; Jacob Alarcon; Linnea Fraser; Khoi Hua; Sungha Jo; Matthew Levy; Helena Mello; Uzoamaka Nwachukwu; Alec Siurek; Audra Stuck; and Eli VanDyke, Indiana University\n   \n    In recent decades, heat waves have been growing as global issues due to climate change. Heat vulnerability is critical, especially for minority people living in cities. In the Advance GIS Class (GEOG-G438/539) at Indiana University Bloomington in Fall 2023, we analyzed heat vulnerability in the top twelve high-populated counties, focusing on social and environmental equity. We tried to build a heat vulnerability index with socioeconomic data (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, income, education attainment, housing status) and physical environment variables (e.g., surface temperature, canopy cover, and imperviousness). The results highlight diverse disparities in heat vulnerability levels associated with demographic and socioeconomic status across Indiana. While further analysis is required to enhance the heat vulnerability index, this analysis can alleviate extreme heat by prioritizing the areas for strategic plans such as regulating development, increasing tree cover, setting emergency cooling shelters, etc. \n    \n    ---\n\n4. **Identifying the Optimal Approach for Developing a 1-km Downscaled Soil Moisture Product for CONUS**\n\n    Eshita Eva, The Ohio State University; and Steven M. Quiring, The Ohio State University\n\n    Developing improved methods for visualizing soil moisture at a fine resolution could prove useful in climatology, hydrology, the agricultural sector, drought monitoring, remote sensing, and other impacts. The recent evolution of remote sensing technology has provided additional tools for monitoring the near-surface moisture of soil across the continental United States (CONUS). The aim of this study is to determine the importance of different environmental variables on downscaled soil moisture products by leveraging remote sensing soil moisture. This study analyzes soil moisture data derived from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive Level 3 (SMAP L3) satellite mission. For downscaling soil moisture data to a 1-kilometer resolution, ancillary variables including precipitation, antecedent precipitation index (API), mean temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, daytime range temperature (DTR), dew point temperature, soil texture, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), land use land cover, elevation, slope, and aspect is taken into account. To determine the optimal soil moisture value at any location, a machine learning model is used called random forest. In addition, examining the significance of random forest variables provides an opportunity to examine the association between soil moisture and environmental variables.\n    \n    ---\n\n5. **Making Open-Source Georeferencing Technology Collections-Ready with the Allmaps Platform**\n\n    Stephen Appel, UW-Milwaukee Libraries - American Geographical Society Library; and Ian Spangler, Leventhal Map and Education Center, Boston Public Library\n\n    This presentation will introduce the NEH/IMLS Digital Humanities Advancement Grant funded project *Making Open-Source Georeferencing Technology Collections-Ready with the Allmaps Platform*, a partnership between the Leventhal Map & Education Center at Boston Public Library, the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and the Allmaps Project to build an open-source platform for georeferencing digitized cartographic collections, based on the Allmaps software library already under development. By building a patron-facing digital interface for georeferencing, hundreds of cultural institutions around the world can make their digitized map collections newly vibrant for scholars, educators, and the public. The project involves four major goals: (1) creating an interface for institutions to manage georeferencing project workflows and building inter-institutional collections; (2) writing documentation & educational modules that help both institutions and individuals get started using Allmaps; (3) creating two framework integrations—one for the open-source software GeoBlacklight used by LMEC, and one for the commercial software CONTENTdm used by AGSL—that allow Allmaps to be easily incorporated into widely-used collections management systems; and (4) establishing the Consortium for Public Geography, a coalition of institutions and individuals tasked with the maintenance of Allmaps, including long-term data management, scholarly engagement, and general governance.\n    \n    ---\n\n### Break\n\n12:40 - 12:45 CST / 1:40 - 1:45 EST\n\n---\n\n### Presentations 2: Urban*\n\n12:45 - 1:45 CST / 1:45 - 2:45 EST\n\n*Facilitator: Laura McElfresh, University of Minnesota; Slide Operator: Nicole Scholtz, University of Michigan*\n\n#### An interactive biodiversity model for seven taxa in urban New York City\n\nMarci Meixler, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey; Kim Fisher, Wildlife Conservation Society; Eric W. Sanderson, New York Biological Garden\n\nDeclines in biodiversity have prompted efforts aimed at promoting resilience and producing sound ecosystem management plans particularly in urban coastal ecosystems vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.  Our focus in this study was on development, demonstration, and testing of a biodiversity model within Visionmaker,nyc, an interactive online tool for resilience decision-making in New York City (NYC).  Our biodiversity model utilizes information on habitat type, area and latitude (from user input), species-habitat preferences and species minimum habitat areas for 4,147 possible species (from the literature), and established ecological principles (latitude-enhanced species-area curves) to calculate species richness and composition for amphibians, birds, freshwater fish, mammals, marine fish, plants, and reptiles.  Model validation for combined species and sites by taxon showed that all taxa had significantly small (P≤0.05) sign test probabilities indicating good agreement between observed and predicted presence/absence.  Looking by individual species and across sites by taxon, 70-86% of species had significantly small (P≤0.05) sign test probabilities with freshwater fish the fewest significant results and plants the most.  Our biodiversity model has proven effective at predicting species richness and species composition across a variety of habitats in a complex urban environment. Ecologists, planners and interested citizens can use our biodiversity model within Visionmaker.nyc to create sustainable and resilient visions of NYC now and into the future.\n\n---\n\n#### Association between COVID-19 policies and spatial distribution of burglaries and robberies in New York City*\n\nNina Yin, Penn State University\n\nThis project examines the associations between COVID-19 policies and the spatial distribution of burglaries and robberies in New York City. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, mitigation policies were implemented at both a state (New York) and city (New York City) level. These policies, including lockdowns, phased re-openings, and mask policies, impacted human mobility within the city, and changed urban dynamics. These changes may have inadvertently affected the spatial distributions of crime in the city, resulting in differences in distributions before, during, and after the lifting of these policies. By analyzing spatial data on robberies and burglaries using a temporal analysis framework, this project gauges the correlations between specific COVID-19 measures, and fluctuations in the frequency and spatial distributions of robberies and burglaries in New York City. Uncovering such correlations, and their changes over space and time, would help shed light on the impact of COVID-19 policies on these crimes, and could guide policy makers, law enforcement, and urban planners in how to best address issues of crime during crises such as pandemics. Additionally, results from this project can help researchers and policy makers better understand the impact of the pandemic on crime in New York City, and therefore help them make more informed policy decisions should similar crises occur in the future.   \n\n---\n\n### LUNCH / COFFEE BREAK\n\n1:45 - 2:15 CST / 2:45 - 3:15 EST\n\n---\n\n### Presentations 3: Technical\n\n2:15 - 3:15 CST / 3:15 - 4:15 EST \n\n*Facilitator: Kathleen Weessies, Michigan State University; Slide Operator: Karen Majewicz, University of Minnesota*\n\n#### The mapKurator System: A Complete Pipeline for Extracting and Linking Text from Historical Maps \n\nZekun Li; Jina Kim;  Yijun Lin;  Min Namgung; Leeje Jang; and Yao-Yi Chiang, University of Minnesota\n\nScanned historical maps in libraries and archives are valuable repositories of geographic data that often do not exist elsewhere. Despite the potential of machine learning tools like the Google Vision APIs for automatically transcribing text from these maps into machine-readable formats, they do not work well with large-sized images (e.g., high-resolution scanned documents), cannot infer the relation between the recognized text and other datasets, and are challenging to integrate with post-processing tools. This paper introduces the mapKurator system, an end-to-end system integrating machine learning models with a comprehensive data processing pipeline. mapKurator empowers automated extraction, post-processing, and linkage of text labels from large numbers of large-dimension historical map scans. The output data, comprising bounding polygons and recognized text, is in the standard GeoJSON format, making it easily modifiable within Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The proposed system allows users to quickly generate valuable data from large numbers of historical maps for in-depth analysis of the map content and, in turn, encourages map findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR principles). We deployed the mapKurator system and enabled the processing of over 60,000 maps and over 100 million text/place names in the David Rumsey Historical Map collection. We also demonstrated a seamless integration of mapKurator with a collaborative web platform to enable accessing automated approaches for extracting and linking text labels from historical map scans and collective work to improve the results. \n\n---\n\n#### Python and ArcGIS Notebooks Improve Reproducibility of County Health Indicator  \n\nJess Hoffelder and Ganhua Lu, University of Wisconsin Madison Population Health Institute\n\nAccess to exercise opportunities is a form of environmental justice and can impact community health. The County Health Rankings uses the creation of buffers around parks and recreational facilities to determine the proportion of county residents within census blocks near locations for exercise. The manual process was updated by implementing Python code in an ArcGIS Notebook to automate the workflow for buffer creation, spatial intersect, data summation and export, saving 100 plus hours annually and limiting human error in interaction with standard geoprocessing tool interfaces. The modified approach resulted from collaboration between staff with expertise in GIS and Python. The ArcPy Python package was utilized, in addition to external Python libraries. Additionally, this approach allowed the use of a single software combining steps previously completed between ArcGIS Pro and SAS; standardization and technical documentation of the annual calculation process between years; and flexibility in use of team time through improved accessibility of the process for analysts without high levels of GIS expertise. \n\n---\n\n#### Artificial Photosynthesis for Hydrogen Fuel: Feasibility and Siting \n\nBrice Richardson; Will Hope; and Eli Ganong, University of Wisconsin-Madison \n\nWe explored the feasibility of artificial photosynthesis (AP) as applied to hydrogen fuel production in two modules. In the first, we sought to understand the perceptions of AP in academia, industry, and the government as well as the challenges and opportunities facing the technology. In the second, we conducted a site suitability analysis for AP facilities across Wisconsin. To accomplish the first objective, we conducted semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in academia and government and examined industry press releases. While AP faces some challenges, these do not detract from the technology’s feasibility to be implemented on a short timescale. We then moved to the second portion of the study using ArcGIS to find suitable sites for installing production facilities based on criteria including co-location with existing infrastructure and proximity to natural gas pipelines and traffic centers. We found the Fox Valley and Madison areas to be best suited for AP facilities, prompting us to zoom into Madison to find suitable locations on a local scale.\n\n---\n\n### Break\n3:15 - 3:20 CST / 4:15 - 4:20 EST\n\n---\n\n### Lightning Talks B\n3:20 - 4:10 CST / 4:20 - 5:10 EST\n\n*Facilitator: Kathleen Weessies, Michigan State University; Slide Operator: Karen Majewicz, University of Minnesota*\n\n1. **Close Beside the Winding Cedar: Demonstrating a Local History StoryMap**\n\n    Eric Tans, Michigan State University Libraries\n\n    While there are numerous works detailing Michigan State University’s history from a wide range of perspectives, none focus solely on arguably the campus’ most notable and beloved feature: the Red Cedar River. This is a considerable oversight, taking into consideration the significant role the river has played in university life, campus development, and teaching and research. The StoryMap “Close Beside the Winding Cedar” builds on historical and archival research into the cultural and institutional history of the Red Cedar River and its relationship to Michigan State University and aims to fill this gap in telling a part of Michigan State University’s story. Produced as part of the MSU Library Digital Scholarship Lab’s Project Incubator and weaving together a cohesive narrative employing maps, images, documents, and timelines, “Close Beside the Winding Cedar” acknowledges the crucial role the Red Cedar has played in the history of a major institution in Michigan’s history.\n    \n    ---\n\n2. **Integration of Satellite and UAV Imagery for Assessing Corn Nitrogen Status at Early Vegetative Growth Stages**\n\n    Ana Gabriela Morales-Ona; Robert Nielsen; James Camberato; and Daniel Quinn, Purdue University\n\n    Nitrogen fertilizer accounts for 20-25% of the variable cost of production for rotation maize in Indiana. Spatial variability within fields and variable, unpredictable rainfall patterns make N a challenging nutrient to manage, with up to 65% of the nitrogen applied being lost to the environment. Post-emergence sidedress applications of N fertilizer can reduce N loss and improve plant uptake, so efficient and practical ways to identify maize N status at early maize growth stages is key to assessing plant N needs. The objectives of this study were to 1) compare spatial and spectral metrics for predicting biomass, 2) assess aerial imagery derived metrics for estimating N uptake and concentration, and 3) identify if integration of spatial metrics derived from UAV imagery integrated with spectral metrics from satellite imagery can improve N uptake prediction at early growth stages. To accomplish this, two large scale field trials were used for the study. Multispectral UAV (0.05 m resolution) and satellite imagery (3 m resolution) was acquired at early maize growth stages prior to the sidedress application of fertilizer treatments. Imagery was post-processed to calculate multiple vegetative indices and extract canopy cover fraction. Biomass samples were collected from pre-determined sampling areas to obtain dry matter weight and calculate N uptake. Regression analysis determined the relationship between biomass, nitrogen uptake, and metrics derived from UAV and satellite imagery. The results suggest that the integration of satellite and UAV imagery derived metrics can be used to assess maize N status in a time efficient way.\n    \n    ---\n\n3. **Leveraging GIS Resources at Indiana University**\n\n    Katie Chapman, Indiana University\n\n    At Indiana University, GIS is an essential component of the work done by many of our students, faculty, and staff. From the classroom to administration, research, and public outreach, the IU community draws on the GIS resources available from our Esri Education subscription to visualize and analyze GIS data both close to home and across the globe to support public service, community building, information sharing, and our students’ career development. Research Technologies, a division of University Information and Technical Services, provides access to Esri’s GIS software for all members of the IU community. In addition to supporting GIS work at all of IU’s campuses, we also support the Indiana Spatial Data Portal (ISDP), a publicly accessible and annually increasing repository of GIS data from Indiana. The Indiana GIS data, primarily collected by the Indiana Geographic Information Office (GIO), includes downloadable orthoimagery and LiDAR data for the State. Here, we showcase some of the recent products and workflows developed by the IU GIS community.  \n    \n    ---\n\n4. **Participatory GIS and Place-Network Investigations of Neglected Places: Exploring Nature Crime in Vietnam***\n\n    Elle Jingjing Xu; Judith Rakowski, UMD; and Meredith L. Gore, University of Maryland; Laure Joanny and Luan Van Nguyen, Fauna & Flora; and James Slade, Re:wild\n\n    Integrating participatory knowledge into efforts to resolve nature crime is appealing to decision makers because it offers inclusion of neglected spaces and thus more optimized and sustainable solutions. Participatory mapping has been widely used in rural conservation contexts and place-network investigations are offering promising applications to urban street crime problems at the neighborhood level. We explore the application of place-network investigations of wildlife poaching and trafficking, a globally distributed type of nature crime, in and around Pu Mat National Park in Vietnam in 2023. Using repeated measures and participatory mapping with local stakeholders and crime data from conservation rangers and nongovernmental organizations, we used QGIS to map the distribution of crime sites, corruption spots, comfort spaces, and convergent settings. We then used descriptive statistics and point pattern analysis to identify spatial patterns of each type of location, LISA statistics for hotspot detection, and geographically weighted regression model to explain how attributes such as facility type, distance to road affect the clustering of crime associated locations. Preliminary results identify a range of neglected spaces and spatial network trends: corruption spots facilitate wildlife crime outside the protected area concentrated in towns and markets; comfort spaces are more widely dispersed within protected areas in comparison to convergence settings and corruption spots. Participatory spatial data collection methods can help identify neglected spaces, places, and their spatial relationships. With a more holistic spatial data landscape, nature crime prevention strategies may be optimized for social legitimacy, cost efficiency, safety and sustainability.\n    \n    ---\n\n5. **Habitat Suitability and Behavioral Responses to Anthropogenic Disturbances of a Local Endangered Bear Species in Taiwan***\n\n    Fang Chen and Neil Carter, University of Michigan; Mei-Hsiu Hwang, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology\n\n    Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) are locally endangered in Taiwan due to habitat loss and poaching. Moreover, the recent proliferation of illegal snare traps has escalated threats to this species, leading to higher mortality rates and physical injuries. Despite the severity of the situation and the threats to this endangered species, there remains a lack of information regarding the favored habitat traits of bears and the behavioral impacts of injuries caused by snare traps. To address this knowledge gap, we integrated high-resolution movement data from 15 GPS-collared bears with various environmental covariates to (i) model habitat suitability and (ii) determine the influence of snare-induced injuries on space-use patterns. We utilized Resource Selection Function to identify environmental variables impacting bears’ habitat selection. The results were ranked on a scale from 1 to 10 and visualized as a habitat suitability map. Furthermore, our results revealed that injured bears show distinct habitat selection patterns compared to their non-injured counterparts. Injured bears tended to select less rugged terrains, likely attributed to mobility limitations resulting from snare-induced injuries. In addition, injured bears show stronger preference for areas closer to trails, potentially leading to increased future human-bear encounters and conflicts. Through this study, we have identified critical areas warranting prioritized conservation efforts and underscored the behavioral impact of snaring on Asiatic black bears. This groundwork establishes a crucial foundation for future conservation plans benefiting both Asiatic black bears and the ecosystem.\n\n*Presentations listed with an asterisk were not recorded at the request of the presenter","src/content/docs/conference/2023.md","b384abf2f1364ca3",{"html":292,"metadata":293},"\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h1\">\u003Ch1 id=\"btaa-gis-conference-2023\">BTAA GIS Conference 2023\u003C/h1>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#btaa-gis-conference-2023\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “BTAA GIS Conference 2023”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>!!! success “The 2023 BTAA GIS Conference has concluded.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"expressive-code\">\u003Clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/_astro/ec.v4551.css\">\u003Cscript type=\"module\" src=\"/_astro/ec.p1z7b.js\">\u003C/script>\u003Cfigure class=\"frame not-content\">\u003Cfigcaption class=\"header\">\u003C/figcaption>\u003Cpre data-language=\"plaintext\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cdiv class=\"ec-line\">\u003Cdiv class=\"code\">\u003Cspan style=\"--0:#d6deeb;--1:#403f53\">The 2023 Conference was held on November 8th and featured a keynote, presentations, lightning talks, and a map gallery.\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003C/div>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\u003Cdiv class=\"copy\">\u003Cbutton title=\"Copy to clipboard\" data-copied=\"Copied!\" data-code=\"The 2023 Conference was held on November 8th and featured a keynote, presentations, lightning talks, and a map gallery.\">\u003Cdiv>\u003C/div>\u003C/button>\u003C/div>\u003C/figure>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"conference-recordings\">Conference Recordings\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#conference-recordings\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Conference Recordings”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>View the 2023 conference recordings here or on \u003Ca href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNMgmHMZCEbfXXJDje-5x4eUKKPgjPiLC&#x26;si=EiSM3DNGPVYIsSkq\">YouTube\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?si=WVC2dbHqKyoURhyJ&#x26;list=PLNMgmHMZCEbfXXJDje-5x4eUKKPgjPiLC\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

Agroforestry is seen as one solution that has been promoted by numerous agencies and organizations to improve food and livelihood security without undue negative impacts on the environment. While this technology exists in many forms and has been practiced in specific locations across Africa for generations, the widespread adoption and “up-scaling” of agroforestry requires consideration of whether the agroforestry planting scheme and key specie(s) included within that scheme are not only suitable for a given ecosystem but also if cultural practices/traditions in an area will favor up-take. GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is an effective tool for structuring and evaluating criteria for decision support, through there is a noted absence in current literature illustrating the integration of cultural legacy or indigenous knowledge into MCDA, particularly in settings where field survey of individuals or societies is not an option. In such a case, the implementation of a methodological framework for gleaning cultural legacy or indigenous knowledge from ethnographic works and other pertinent research is critical for developing an output of suitability that is culturally appropriate. This project is structured to illustrate how topological, ecological, and cultural criteria can be integrated in GIS-MCDA for the assessment of plantain-based agroforestry site suitability in Uganda. By accounting for cultural criteria in MCDA suitability analysis and identifying sites where cultural traditions favor a given intervention, the potential for up-take of promoted interventions is likely to be improved.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"new-jersey-state-regulatory-riparian-zone-map\">New Jersey State Regulatory Riparian Zone Map\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#new-jersey-state-regulatory-riparian-zone-map\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “New Jersey State Regulatory Riparian Zone Map”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Kate Douthat, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey; Larry Torok, New Jersey DEP\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This map shows the locations and widths of regulatory riparian zones of the streams of New Jersey according to the Flood Hazard Area Control Act (FHA) Rules (N.J.A.C 7:13-4.1). The FHA designates riparian zones around streams, inside of which development and land disturbance is limited in order to protect target species, habitat, and water quality. The width and upstream extent of the buffer is based on state Surface Water Quality Standards and the location of habitat for endangered and threatened species. The State has a map of surface water quality standards that classifies streams by their type, designated uses, and anti-degradation statuses, but until now, the location of corresponding protective riparian zones was not mapped. Riparian zones had to be interpreted directly from the text of the rules—a complicated task for most users.  Some technical issues we encountered when making this map included reconciling different sets of stream centerlines and creating isodistances with ESRI’s new Trace Network tool. Other challenges included reconciling data definitions and regulatory definitions. The final map is not able to fully translate the rules into GIS due the limitations of the current data, e.g. the location of the top of bank of streams, which is a fine-scale topographic feature that must be identified in the field. However, this map provides the public with a new understanding of the location of riparian zones and stream protections at specific areas of interest as well as landscape-level patterns.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"lunch--coffee-break\">LUNCH / COFFEE BREAK\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#lunch--coffee-break\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “LUNCH / COFFEE BREAK”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>11:20 - 11:50 CST / 12:20 - 12:50 EST\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"lightning-talks-a\">Lightning Talks A\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#lightning-talks-a\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Lightning Talks A”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>11:50 - 12:40 CST / 12:50 - 1:40 EST -\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Facilitator: Karen Majewicz, University of Minnesota; Slide Operator: Nicole Scholtz, University of Michigan\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>There and Back Again: An Analysis of the Movement of Avian Specimens Through Time and Space\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Summer Mengarelli and Brian Weeks, University of  Michigan;Shane DuBay, University of Texas-Arlington\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Avian specimens, like other biological specimens housed in natural history museums and herbaria throughout the world, are useful sources of data in wide-ranging topics including environmental and ecological issues, species distribution and abundance, morphology, biomimicry, and phenology. The origins of avian specimen collection coincide with the beginnings of colonialism, and while specimens collected in centuries past retain their utility in modern research, they also retain a complicated history. This project analyzes the movement of these specimens through space in order to understand how specimen collection is situated or complicated in the ongoing legacy of colonial science. Using georeferenced specimen records from natural history collections in North America and Europe, we investigate clusters of specimen movement through history and ask whether the distance between collection and storage has lengthened or shortened. We apply our results to a discussion of whether specimen collection’s role in colonial science has faded, and pose the question of what repatriation might look like in the context of natural history museums. This geospatial analysis of the history of avian specimen collection can act as a starting place for broader exploration into the impact of colonialism in the practices of natural history knowledge work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Analyzing Seasonal Crime Trends in Chicago: Examining the Impact of Temperature and Geography on Public Safety\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Abhimanyu Hans and Milan Budhathoki, University of Maryland\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This study investigates the seasonal trend of crime rates in the City of Chicago over a 20-year period. Daily crime location data were categorized into several crime types based on the classification code developed by law enforcement agencies, then spatially aggregated at the census tract level to examine spatial and temporal correlations. The study tested the hypothesis that certain crimes increase with warmer temperatures while others rise with colder temperatures, and that higher temperatures predict higher crime overall. Urban climate data from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and public crime data will be compared to identify census tracts sensitive to seasonal temperature changes. The findings aim to help law enforcement, urban planners, and stakeholders locate areas susceptible to heat stress and develop interventions to reduce violence and structural racism in highly crime-prone neighborhoods. This novel investigation of the overlooked links between climate, geography, and crime can inform strategies to mitigate urban heat impacts on public safety.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Mapping Heat Vulnerability in Indiana\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yuri Kim; Adriana Abreu; Jacob Alarcon; Linnea Fraser; Khoi Hua; Sungha Jo; Matthew Levy; Helena Mello; Uzoamaka Nwachukwu; Alec Siurek; Audra Stuck; and Eli VanDyke, Indiana University\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In recent decades, heat waves have been growing as global issues due to climate change. Heat vulnerability is critical, especially for minority people living in cities. In the Advance GIS Class (GEOG-G438/539) at Indiana University Bloomington in Fall 2023, we analyzed heat vulnerability in the top twelve high-populated counties, focusing on social and environmental equity. We tried to build a heat vulnerability index with socioeconomic data (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, income, education attainment, housing status) and physical environment variables (e.g., surface temperature, canopy cover, and imperviousness). The results highlight diverse disparities in heat vulnerability levels associated with demographic and socioeconomic status across Indiana. While further analysis is required to enhance the heat vulnerability index, this analysis can alleviate extreme heat by prioritizing the areas for strategic plans such as regulating development, increasing tree cover, setting emergency cooling shelters, etc.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Identifying the Optimal Approach for Developing a 1-km Downscaled Soil Moisture Product for CONUS\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eshita Eva, The Ohio State University; and Steven M.

The recent evolution of remote sensing technology has provided additional tools for monitoring the near-surface moisture of soil across the continental United States (CONUS). The aim of this study is to determine the importance of different environmental variables on downscaled soil moisture products by leveraging remote sensing soil moisture. This study analyzes soil moisture data derived from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive Level 3 (SMAP L3) satellite mission. For downscaling soil moisture data to a 1-kilometer resolution, ancillary variables including precipitation, antecedent precipitation index (API), mean temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, daytime range temperature (DTR), dew point temperature, soil texture, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), land use land cover, elevation, slope, and aspect is taken into account. To determine the optimal soil moisture value at any location, a machine learning model is used called random forest. In addition, examining the significance of random forest variables provides an opportunity to examine the association between soil moisture and environmental variables.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Making Open-Source Georeferencing Technology Collections-Ready with the Allmaps Platform\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stephen Appel, UW-Milwaukee Libraries - American Geographical Society Library; and Ian Spangler, Leventhal Map and Education Center, Boston Public Library\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This presentation will introduce the NEH/IMLS Digital Humanities Advancement Grant funded project \u003Cem>Making Open-Source Georeferencing Technology Collections-Ready with the Allmaps Platform\u003C/em>, a partnership between the Leventhal Map &#x26; Education Center at Boston Public Library, the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and the Allmaps Project to build an open-source platform for georeferencing digitized cartographic collections, based on the Allmaps software library already under development.

Our biodiversity model utilizes information on habitat type, area and latitude (from user input), species-habitat preferences and species minimum habitat areas for 4,147 possible species (from the literature), and established ecological principles (latitude-enhanced species-area curves) to calculate species richness and composition for amphibians, birds, freshwater fish, mammals, marine fish, plants, and reptiles.  Model validation for combined species and sites by taxon showed that all taxa had significantly small (P≤0.05) sign test probabilities indicating good agreement between observed and predicted presence/absence.  Looking by individual species and across sites by taxon, 70-86% of species had significantly small (P≤0.05) sign test probabilities with freshwater fish the fewest significant results and plants the most.  Our biodiversity model has proven effective at predicting species richness and species composition across a variety of habitats in a complex urban environment.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, mitigation policies were implemented at both a state (New York) and city (New York City) level. These policies, including lockdowns, phased re-openings, and mask policies, impacted human mobility within the city, and changed urban dynamics. These changes may have inadvertently affected the spatial distributions of crime in the city, resulting in differences in distributions before, during, and after the lifting of these policies. By analyzing spatial data on robberies and burglaries using a temporal analysis framework, this project gauges the correlations between specific COVID-19 measures, and fluctuations in the frequency and spatial distributions of robberies and burglaries in New York City. Uncovering such correlations, and their changes over space and time, would help shed light on the impact of COVID-19 policies on these crimes, and could guide policy makers, law enforcement, and urban planners in how to best address issues of crime during crises such as pandemics. Additionally, results from this project can help researchers and policy makers better understand the impact of the pandemic on crime in New York City, and therefore help them make more informed policy decisions should similar crises occur in the future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"lunch--coffee-break-1\">LUNCH / COFFEE BREAK\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#lunch--coffee-break-1\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “LUNCH / COFFEE BREAK”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>1:45 - 2:15 CST / 2:45 - 3:15 EST\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"presentations-3-technical\">Presentations 3: Technical\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#presentations-3-technical\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Presentations 3: Technical”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>2:15 - 3:15 CST / 3:15 - 4:15 EST\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Facilitator: Kathleen Weessies, Michigan State University; Slide Operator: Karen Majewicz, University of Minnesota\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"the-mapkurator-system-a-complete-pipeline-for-extracting-and-linking-text-from-historical-maps\">The mapKurator System: A Complete Pipeline for Extracting and Linking Text from Historical Maps\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#the-mapkurator-system-a-complete-pipeline-for-extracting-and-linking-text-from-historical-maps\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “The mapKurator System: A Complete Pipeline for Extracting and Linking Text from Historical Maps”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Zekun Li; Jina Kim;  Yijun Lin;  Min Namgung; Leeje Jang; and Yao-Yi Chiang, University of Minnesota\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Scanned historical maps in libraries and archives are valuable repositories of geographic data that often do not exist elsewhere. Despite the potential of machine learning tools like the Google Vision APIs for automatically transcribing text from these maps into machine-readable formats, they do not work well with large-sized images (e.g., high-resolution scanned documents), cannot infer the relation between the recognized text and other datasets, and are challenging to integrate with post-processing tools. This paper introduces the mapKurator system, an end-to-end system integrating machine learning models with a comprehensive data processing pipeline. mapKurator empowers automated extraction, post-processing, and linkage of text labels from large numbers of large-dimension historical map scans. The output data, comprising bounding polygons and recognized text, is in the standard GeoJSON format, making it easily modifiable within Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The proposed system allows users to quickly generate valuable data from large numbers of historical maps for in-depth analysis of the map content and, in turn, encourages map findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR principles). We deployed the mapKurator system and enabled the processing of over 60,000 maps and over 100 million text/place names in the David Rumsey Historical Map collection. We also demonstrated a seamless integration of mapKurator with a collaborative web platform to enable accessing automated approaches for extracting and linking text labels from historical map scans and collective work to improve the results.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"python-and-arcgis-notebooks-improve-reproducibility-of-county-health-indicator\">Python and ArcGIS Notebooks Improve Reproducibility of County Health Indicator\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#python-and-arcgis-notebooks-improve-reproducibility-of-county-health-indicator\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Python and ArcGIS Notebooks Improve Reproducibility of County Health Indicator”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Jess Hoffelder and Ganhua Lu, University of Wisconsin Madison Population Health Institute\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Access to exercise opportunities is a form of environmental justice and can impact community health. The County Health Rankings uses the creation of buffers around parks and recreational facilities to determine the proportion of county residents within census blocks near locations for exercise. The manual process was updated by implementing Python code in an ArcGIS Notebook to automate the workflow for buffer creation, spatial intersect, data summation and export, saving 100 plus hours annually and limiting human error in interaction with standard geoprocessing tool interfaces. The modified approach resulted from collaboration between staff with expertise in GIS and Python. The ArcPy Python package was utilized, in addition to external Python libraries. Additionally, this approach allowed the use of a single software combining steps previously completed between ArcGIS Pro and SAS; standardization and technical documentation of the annual calculation process between years; and flexibility in use of team time through improved accessibility of the process for analysts without high levels of GIS expertise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"artificial-photosynthesis-for-hydrogen-fuel-feasibility-and-siting\">Artificial Photosynthesis for Hydrogen Fuel: Feasibility and Siting\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#artificial-photosynthesis-for-hydrogen-fuel-feasibility-and-siting\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Artificial Photosynthesis for Hydrogen Fuel: Feasibility and Siting”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Brice Richardson; Will Hope; and Eli Ganong, University of Wisconsin-Madison\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We explored the feasibility of artificial photosynthesis (AP) as applied to hydrogen fuel production in two modules.

This is a considerable oversight, taking into consideration the significant role the river has played in university life, campus development, and teaching and research. The StoryMap “Close Beside the Winding Cedar” builds on historical and archival research into the cultural and institutional history of the Red Cedar River and its relationship to Michigan State University and aims to fill this gap in telling a part of Michigan State University’s story. Produced as part of the MSU Library Digital Scholarship Lab’s Project Incubator and weaving together a cohesive narrative employing maps, images, documents, and timelines, “Close Beside the Winding Cedar” acknowledges the crucial role the Red Cedar has played in the history of a major institution in Michigan’s history.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Integration of Satellite and UAV Imagery for Assessing Corn Nitrogen Status at Early Vegetative Growth Stages\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ana Gabriela Morales-Ona; Robert Nielsen; James Camberato; and Daniel Quinn, Purdue University\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Nitrogen fertilizer accounts for 20-25% of the variable cost of production for rotation maize in Indiana. Spatial variability within fields and variable, unpredictable rainfall patterns make N a challenging nutrient to manage, with up to 65% of the nitrogen applied being lost to the environment. Post-emergence sidedress applications of N fertilizer can reduce N loss and improve plant uptake, so efficient and practical ways to identify maize N status at early maize growth stages is key to assessing plant N needs. The objectives of this study were to 1) compare spatial and spectral metrics for predicting biomass, 2) assess aerial imagery derived metrics for estimating N uptake and concentration, and 3) identify if integration of spatial metrics derived from UAV imagery integrated with spectral metrics from satellite imagery can improve N uptake prediction at early growth stages. To accomplish this, two large scale field trials were used for the study. Multispectral UAV (0.05 m resolution) and satellite imagery (3 m resolution) was acquired at early maize growth stages prior to the sidedress application of fertilizer treatments. Imagery was post-processed to calculate multiple vegetative indices and extract canopy cover fraction. Biomass samples were collected from pre-determined sampling areas to obtain dry matter weight and calculate N uptake. Regression analysis determined the relationship between biomass, nitrogen uptake, and metrics derived from UAV and satellite imagery. The results suggest that the integration of satellite and UAV imagery derived metrics can be used to assess maize N status in a time efficient way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Leveraging GIS Resources at Indiana University\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Katie Chapman, Indiana University\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At Indiana University, GIS is an essential component of the work done by many of our students, faculty, and staff.

Participatory mapping has been widely used in rural conservation contexts and place-network investigations are offering promising applications to urban street crime problems at the neighborhood level. We explore the application of place-network investigations of wildlife poaching and trafficking, a globally distributed type of nature crime, in and around Pu Mat National Park in Vietnam in 2023. Using repeated measures and participatory mapping with local stakeholders and crime data from conservation rangers and nongovernmental organizations, we used QGIS to map the distribution of crime sites, corruption spots, comfort spaces, and convergent settings. We then used descriptive statistics and point pattern analysis to identify spatial patterns of each type of location, LISA statistics for hotspot detection, and geographically weighted regression model to explain how attributes such as facility type, distance to road affect the clustering of crime associated locations. Preliminary results identify a range of neglected spaces and spatial network trends: corruption spots facilitate wildlife crime outside the protected area concentrated in towns and markets; comfort spaces are more widely dispersed within protected areas in comparison to convergence settings and corruption spots. Participatory spatial data collection methods can help identify neglected spaces, places, and their spatial relationships. With a more holistic spatial data landscape, nature crime prevention strategies may be optimized for social legitimacy, cost efficiency, safety and sustainability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Habitat Suitability and Behavioral Responses to Anthropogenic Disturbances of a Local Endangered Bear Species in Taiwan\u003C/strong>*\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fang Chen and Neil Carter, University of Michigan; Mei-Hsiu Hwang, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) are locally endangered in Taiwan due to habitat loss and poaching. Moreover, the recent proliferation of illegal snare traps has escalated threats to this species, leading to higher mortality rates and physical injuries. Despite the severity of the situation and the threats to this endangered species, there remains a lack of information regarding the favored habitat traits of bears and the behavioral impacts of injuries caused by snare traps. To address this knowledge gap, we integrated high-resolution movement data from 15 GPS-collared bears with various environmental covariates to (i) model habitat suitability and (ii) determine the influence of snare-induced injuries on space-use patterns. We utilized Resource Selection Function to identify environmental variables impacting bears’ habitat selection. The results were ranked on a scale from 1 to 10 and visualized as a habitat suitability map. Furthermore, our results revealed that injured bears show distinct habitat selection patterns compared to their non-injured counterparts. Injured bears tended to select less rugged terrains, likely attributed to mobility limitations resulting from snare-induced injuries. In addition, injured bears show stronger preference for areas closer to trails, potentially leading to increased future human-bear encounters and conflicts. Through this study, we have identified critical areas warranting prioritized conservation efforts and underscored the behavioral impact of snaring on Asiatic black bears. This groundwork establishes a crucial foundation for future conservation plans benefiting both Asiatic black bears and the ecosystem.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>*Presentations listed with an asterisk were not recorded at the request of the presenter\u003C/p>",{"headings":294,"localImagePaths":350,"remoteImagePaths":351,"frontmatter":352,"imagePaths":354},[295,298,299,300,301,304,307,310,313,316,319,322,323,326,329,332,334,337,340,343,346,347],{"depth":52,"slug":296,"text":297},"btaa-gis-conference-2023","BTAA GIS Conference 2023",{"depth":100,"slug":114,"text":115},{"depth":100,"slug":213,"text":214},{"depth":76,"slug":124,"text":125},{"depth":76,"slug":302,"text":303},"keynote-reading-maps-making-searching-and-interpreting-text-on-maps","Keynote: Reading Maps: Making, Searching, and Interpreting Text on Maps",{"depth":76,"slug":305,"text":306},"presentations-1-forests-and-water","Presentations 1: Forests and Water",{"depth":64,"slug":308,"text":309},"identifying-potential-locations-for-water-quality-wetland-installation-using-gis-modeling","Identifying potential locations for water quality wetland installation using GIS modeling",{"depth":64,"slug":311,"text":312},"plaintain-agroforestry-in-uganda-integrating-cultural-legacy-into-multi-criteria-decision-analysis","Plaintain Agroforestry in Uganda: Integrating Cultural Legacy into Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis",{"depth":64,"slug":314,"text":315},"new-jersey-state-regulatory-riparian-zone-map","New Jersey State Regulatory Riparian Zone Map",{"depth":76,"slug":317,"text":318},"lunch--coffee-break","LUNCH / COFFEE BREAK",{"depth":76,"slug":320,"text":321},"lightning-talks-a","Lightning Talks A",{"depth":76,"slug":219,"text":220},{"depth":76,"slug":324,"text":325},"presentations-2-urban","Presentations 2: Urban*",{"depth":64,"slug":327,"text":328},"an-interactive-biodiversity-model-for-seven-taxa-in-urban-new-york-city","An interactive biodiversity model for seven taxa in urban New York City",{"depth":64,"slug":330,"text":331},"association-between-covid-19-policies-and-spatial-distribution-of-burglaries-and-robberies-in-new-york-city","Association between COVID-19 policies and spatial distribution of burglaries and robberies in New York City*",{"depth":76,"slug":333,"text":318},"lunch--coffee-break-1",{"depth":76,"slug":335,"text":336},"presentations-3-technical","Presentations 3: Technical",{"depth":64,"slug":338,"text":339},"the-mapkurator-system-a-complete-pipeline-for-extracting-and-linking-text-from-historical-maps","The mapKurator System: A Complete Pipeline for Extracting and Linking Text from Historical Maps",{"depth":64,"slug":341,"text":342},"python-and-arcgis-notebooks-improve-reproducibility-of-county-health-indicator","Python and ArcGIS Notebooks Improve Reproducibility of County Health Indicator",{"depth":64,"slug":344,"text":345},"artificial-photosynthesis-for-hydrogen-fuel-feasibility-and-siting","Artificial Photosynthesis for Hydrogen Fuel: Feasibility and Siting",{"depth":76,"slug":255,"text":220},{"depth":76,"slug":348,"text":349},"lightning-talks-b","Lightning Talks B",[],[],{"title":283,"description":284,"sidebar":353},{"order":100},[],"conference/2022",{"id":355,"data":357,"body":363,"filePath":364,"digest":365,"rendered":366},{"title":358,"description":359,"editUrl":16,"head":360,"template":50,"sidebar":361,"pagefind":16,"draft":38},"Big Ten GIS Conference 2022","An overview of the Big Ten GIS Conference 2022",[],{"order":64,"hidden":38,"attrs":362},{},"!!! success \"The 2022 BTAA GIS Conference has concluded.\"\n\n\tThe 2022 Conference was held on November 15th and featured presentations, lightning talks, a map gallery, and career panels.\n\n\n## Conference Recordings\n\nView the 2022 conference recordings here or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATUgXF1C-bI&list=PLNMgmHMZCEbc6QXyPUuKCqFdrs8nYj64l).\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLNMgmHMZCEbc6QXyPUuKCqFdrs8nYj64l\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen>\u003C/iframe>\n\n\n## Agenda\n\n\n:material-clock-time-nine-outline: 9:00 - 9:10 CST (10:00 - 10:10 EST) Welcome \n\n\nmaterial-clock-time-nine-outline: 9:10 - 9:50 CST (10:10 - 10:50 EST) Lightning Talks\n\n### Lightning Talks\n\n#### 1. Range Shifts Predicted with Climate Change in a Common North American Songbird\n\t\n**Susan Reed, Indiana University Bloomington**\n    \nWith a net loss of 3 billion North American birds since 1970, and 2.5 billion being native migratory birds, it is critical to investigate population dynamics and threats to species that impact abundance 1 and geographic distribution across space and time. Predicting species range in response to variation in climate is a goal shared among the fields of both conservation and evolutionary ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs) are visual representations of simulated spatial and temporal patterns of a species in response to predictor variables (PVs), making them useful tools for predicting a species’ range for extrapolated future climate scenarios. As rapid environmental change is experienced, animals must adapt to changes in their environment at a minimum of the same rate, lest they risk extinction. Range shifts and adjustments in movement strategies are mechanism of coping with climate change, and SDMs give insight into how these mechanisms may play out in natural populations—information that may be used to forecast population dynamics and persistence. A better understanding of where, when, and how species distributions are shaped provides valuable information to conservation practitioners, evolutionary ecologists, and policy makers for decision-making regarding habitat and species management. Here, I use ArcGIS Pro2 software to demonstrate SDMs of climate niches for a common migratory North American songbird, the slate-colored dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), utilizing contemporary and extrapolated climate scenarios to model changes in its range as it experiences climate change.\n\n#### 2. Estimating Urban Rooftop Solar Power Production Potential In Chicago\n\t\n**Damian Hamielec, Purdue University**\n    \nAnecdotally, Chicago has a lot of underutilized rooftop space. Consider that Chicago is extremely dense with thousands of buildings, it also has that many roofs that are rarely used for patios, gardens/green roofs, or solar installations. This analysis looks to answer how much energy could Chicago generate from rooftop PV installations that are placed in the most optimal locations throughout the city limits.\n\n#### 3. Developing A Predictive Cultural Heritage Model of Michigan\n\t\n**Amanda Tickner, Michigan State University**\n    \nWe present a predictive model for cultural heritage management and preservation that incorporates historical features as a basis for the development of a predictive model for decision making. This presentation will describe our development process and future possibilities for expansion of our model.\n\n#### 4. Deep learning-based tree species identification using UAV RGB images*\n\t\n**Yunmei Huang, Purdue University**\n\t\nInformation at the species level is necessary for precision forest management and biodiversity conservation. However, it remains a challenging task with traditional remote sensing techniques because of the limit in imaging resolution. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as an emerging RS technique, are getting more attentions for their low-cost and high-resolution advantages. However, most of the studies focusing on UAVs images for tree species identification are based on multispectral, hyperspectral images or combined with LiDAR data. The gap exists in using UAVs RGB data to identify tree species at the stand-level in forests with various species, especially for temperate forests. In this study, we built a  species dataset using high-resolution canopy images (3-5 centimeters)  collected by drones from different seasons. Transfer learning techniques were used to test the performance on specie identification using ResNet18, YOLOv5, and EffcientNetb0, which achieved accuracies above 98% among 4 species including northern red oak, black cherry, and white oak. Testing how flight height affects species classification using RGB images from different flight altitudes is one of the projects we are working on. Tree species identification among more species and individual tree detection from natural forests will be part of our future work.\n\n#### 5. How would SES and neighborhood environment influence individuals' physical inactivity and psychological distress in the City of Chicago?*\n\t\n**Bing Han, Purdue University**\n\t\nI propose to explore how adult physical inactivity and serious psychological distress are influenced by individual socio-economic status and neighborhood environment by using GIS data and survey data on the Chicago Data Portal. Previous research has repeatedly found that family socio-economic status is related to individuals’ health through multiple pathways, like nutrition intake, social and emotional functioning, and adoption of health risk behaviors. Meanwhile, community environments, like community crimes, green spaces, and access to public health services, are also important to people’s health. In medical sociology, the interacting effects of social factors on the individual level and resources on the community level on individuals’ health have been explored. However, it usually lacks a view of geography due to the limitation of data or methodology skills. This study aims to apply GIS to the field of medical sociology to better understand the pattern of how health is influenced. The City of Chicago provides resourceful data on health and neighborhood characteristics. I propose to combine the Healthy Chicago Survey on individuals living in poverty and the environmental data regarding green spaces, crimes, race/ethnicity segregation, education, etc. to explore is there is a moderating, say a protective, effect on community/neighborhood level environment on the negative effect of low socioeconomic on individuals’ health outcomes, including physical inactivity and serious psychological distress.\n\n### Session 1: Justice and Social Geography\n\n:material-clock-time-ten-outline: 10:00 - 11:00 CST (11:00 - 12:00 EST)\n    \n#### Reconstructing Historical Neighborhoods from historic Sanborn Maps Using Machine Learning\n    \n**Harvey Miller, Center for Urban and Regional Analysis / The Ohio State University; Yue Lin, CURA/Ohio State; Ningchuan Xiao, CURA/Ohio State; Gerika Logan, CURA/Ohio State** \n    \nThe building of the interstate highway system in US cities in the 20th century split and sometimes destroyed entire neighborhoods, mostly those housing African Americans, immigrants and other minorities. Planners of the system routed some highways, often purposely, through vulnerable and deprived neighborhoods occupied by people of color. Once thriving and full neighborhoods, these neighborhoods were split and, in some cases, even fully demolished for these urban highways. This caused an economic downturn in many of these neighborhoods that lasts until the present day. Remaining residents still live with the negative consequences of these highways, including disconnections, poor air quality, noise and road trauma. The Ghost Neighborhoods of Columbus project will highlight these lost and damaged neighborhoods by using machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques to extract building level data from historic Sanborn fire insurance maps to populate a GIS database, allowing 3D visualizations of the lost urban landscapes, and support analysis of the wealth, communities and activities lost to urban highway construction. This presentation will discuss our workflow and show results from Driving Park and Hanford Village in Columbus, Ohio – two neighborhoods damaged by the construction of interstate highway I-70.\n    \n#### Using maps to communicate the relationship between broadband and health\n    \n**Jess Hoffelder, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute; Anne Roubal, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute**\n    \nBroadband was highlighted as a critically important service during the pandemic. Although it is widely documented that internet availability is inconsistent across rural areas, pockets of neighborhoods in urban areas also lack access. We used the example of Milwaukee, Wisconsin a historically segregated city to show how Federally sanctioned residential segregation in the 1930’s is still reflected in health inequities in socioeconomic health metrics today. We used ArcGIS Pro to map several community socioeconomic metrics such as children in poverty, homeownership rates, and those who have completed high school, as well as historically redlined neighborhoods, against access to high-speed broadband to show the spatial patterns. We then transformed these maps into several GIFs, shared in an article on the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps website and social media platforms, to help users better overlay the different metrics. We find, unsurprisingly, that census tracts with lower percentages of broadband access are correlated with those in which more children live in poverty, fewer individuals own their homes or graduated high school, and were more likely to be redlined in the past. These findings highlight the existence of digital redlining and point to the need to reduce the inequity in broadband access to avoid further harm to communities experiencing disinvestment. \n    \n#### Overcoming the challenges of developing a geospatial database for longitudinal study of urban childhood obesity \n\n**David Tulloch, Rutgers University; Kristen Lloyd, Rutgers University; Michael Yedidia, Rutgers University; Derek Delia, Rutgers University; Robin DeWeese, Arizona State University; Francesco Acciai, Arizona State University; Punam Ohri-Vachaspati, Arizona State University**\n\nChildhood obesity is a complex problem to which a child's environment contributes significantly. Translating the dynamic urban realities of both the food environment and physical activity (PA) environment into consistently measurable variables is a challenging GIS problem, especially in cities with limited municipal data infrastructure. Using proximity as an indicator of access, we created an unique longitudinal dataset for this project which led to a variety of important findings about childhood obesity and access to parks and corner stores, perceptions about safety impacting walkability, and the value of developing an early habit of walking or biking to school. Since 2008, our research team built a routinely updated database representing the dynamic food environment of Camden, Newark, New Brunswick and Trenton, New Jersey. Updates included mapping corner stores, groceries, fruit and vegetable store, bakeries, butchers, supermarkets, as well as fast-food and full-service restaurants. While general food outlet data is acquired from various sources, to be valid each year’s entry needs to be checked with direct contact and using supplementary information sources (e.g. external locational data). Simultaneously, the team mapped the physical activity environment, including parks and PA facilities (like gyms). The database also includes upgrades to community PA features (like parks, trails), extracting information from city agencies, project grants and other public sources.  This presentation will provide a brief overview of the key contributions of GIS to this 15-year collaboration of multidisciplinary multi-institutional childhood obesity research. It will then focus on the geospatial challenges encountered and lessons learned.\n\n### Session 2: Climate and Carbon\n\t\n:material-clock-time-eleven-outline: 11:15 - 12:00 CST (12:15 - 1:00 EST)\n\n*Facilitator: Karen Majewicz, University of Minnesota*\n\n#### Detecting forest carbon storage by remote sensing\n\n**Bowen Li, Purdue University; Guofan Shao, Purdue University; Michael Saunders, Purdue University**\n\nForest is a major contributor in carbon sequestration and reduces impacts from climate change. Carbon storage quantification is useful in evaluating and adjusting forest management activities. Although traditional field measurement such as destructive sampling can accurately estimate carbon on individual trees, it’s very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Remote sensing method, however, uses aerial photos to capture forest change within a short period of time. The extraction and integration of spatial (e.g. canopy height) and spectral information (e.g. greenness) can be used for biomass estimation which eventually converts to carbon.\n\n#### Modeling Present and Future Ecosystem Services and Environmental Justice within an Urban-Coastal Watershed\n\n**Marci Meixler, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ; Max R. Piana, USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Amherst, MA; Alexis Henry, King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks, Seattle, WA**\n\nGlobally, urban-coastal areas are expected to experience substantial landscape shifts as a result of climate change induced sea level rise. Such changes will impact valuable ecosystem services. We developed a model in the urban-coastal Jamaica Bay, New York watershed to quantify present-day carbon sequestration, aboveground carbon storage, and belowground carbon storage ecosystem services and predict the impact of sea level rise through 2100 on future ecosystem services. Due to the disproportional impact of sea level rise on wetlands and natural coastal-fringe habitat, we predicted that carbon sequestration and storage would be significantly impacted in these habitats. Our model projected that future carbon sequestration, aboveground carbon storage, and belowground carbon storage potential in our watershed will have losses up to 0.16%, 15%, and 51%, respectively. We paired our present-day ecosystem service model results with socio-economic data and identified clusters in which mitigation action may help to address impacts of sea level rise and environmental justice. Our work addresses the need for better understanding of urban- coastal ecosystem service flows and the potential impact of future landscape change on environmental and socio-economic factors. Our results provide support for actions to increase urban-coastal resilience through informed design, planning, and management of these ecologically and socially significant landscapes.\n\n:material-clock-time-twelve-outline: 12:00 - 1:00 CST / 1:00 - 2:00 EST - LUNCH BREAK\n\n### Keynote - Our Home on Native Land: Connecting People and Stories using Indigenous Geographies \n\n:material-clock-time-one-outline: 1:00 - 2:00 CST / 2:00 - 3:00 EST \n\n*Facilitator: Joshua Sadvari, Ohio State University*\n\n**Tanya Ruka, Native Land Digital**\n\nTanya Te Miringa Te Rorarangi Ruka is a Māori Indigenous artist and designer living in Te Whānganui-a-Tara, Aotearoa (Wellington, Capital City of New Zealand). The land of 3 tribal nations: Te Atiawa, Ngati Toa Rangatira and Taranaki Whānui ki te Upoko o te Ika.\n\nShe is of Ngati Pakau, Te Uriroroi, Te Parawhau, Te Mahurehure Ngapuhi, and Waitaha descent. She is a member of the Taheke Gazetted Māori Committee of the National Māori Council. She has a Master of Art and Design, and works as an independent indigenous researcher, she is active in environmental issues from an indigenous perspective in Aotearoa and globally. Working with the Waitaha Executive Grandmothers Council she has been documenting and mapping the sacred stories of her Tupuna ancestors as evidence for tribal environmental issues involving land and water protection claims through the Treaty of Waitangi. As a Māori artist she is inspired by her ancestry, and the creation stories that place the land as ancestor, and the Master Navigator voyagers of the Pacific who always kept their eyes on the horizon in hopeful anticipation, bringing the tribe safely to land. Tanya works with Mātauranga Māori (ancestral knowledge and navigational tools) to design pathways of transitional Indigenous Futures and Indigenous Speculative Design. Working in the digital realm creating stories that firmly place indigenous concepts, knowledge, perspectives and ways of being in the landless territories of new imagined futures. She is currently working with dedicated indigenous and non-indigenous textile researchers, academics, scientists, engineers, growers and local Iwi (tribes). Documenting the journey to develop circular designed, native plant fibre materials and textiles that will help to connect people back to the land through indigenous ways of knowing. She is developing a Community Rongoā (Māori native plant medicine) Forest initiative weaving together ancestral knowledge with integrated app based technology. \n\nTanya hopes to continue the legacy of her late Uncle, who was sent by her Grandmother into the world to open up pathways of communication with other indigenous tribal nations. As Research Communications Lead for Nativeland Digital she is honoured to be a part of the team and is dedicated to the representation of indigenous tribal voices and their homelands.\n\n**Rudo Kemper, Native Land Digital**\n\nRudo is a non-native geographer and technologist working in solidarity with Indigenous and other local communities to co-create and use digital tools for self-determination and self-representation. He got his start working with communities in the Amazon rainforest in the early 2010s, where he accompanied communities like the Matawai Maroons of Suriname in mapping and monitoring their ancestral lands, and documenting their traditional knowledge and oral histories. Rudo currently works with Digital Democracy, where he is accompanying communities across the globe in building and using mapping tools to defend their lands, and stewarding the development of the Earth Defenders Toolkit, a collaborative digital platform for earth defender communities and their allies. Originally from Curaçao, Rudo has worked with communities in Suriname, Kenya, Canada, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, and the United States.\n\n:material-clock-time-two-outline: 2:00 - 2:10 CST / 3:00 - 3:10 EST - Break\n\n### Presentations Session 3: GIS Data: Infrastructure and Application\n\n*Facilitator: Theresa Quill, Indiana University*\n\n:material-clock-time-two-outline: 2:10 - 2:50 CST / 3:10 - 3:50 EST\n\n#### Revitalizing the Indiana Spatial Data Portal \n\n**Katie Chapman, Indiana University Bloomington**\n\nOver the past year, Indiana University's Research Data Services team designed and deployed a new platform for the Indiana Spatial Data Portal (ISDP) that allows IU to continue providing sustainable access to the geographic data housed in the ISDP. The portal includes data from the statewide imagery initiatives since 2005, statewide elevation datasets, NAIP imagery, regional datasets, USGS topographic maps, and Sanborn historic maps. The updates to the ISDP included replacing the existing portal with a new user interface and robust middleware, as well as workflows that ingested new data not previously available in the ISDP. The revised platform continues to rely on IU’s Intelligent Infrastructure for portal and server components and UITS Research Technologies storage and database hosting services for search and data delivery. Data on ISDP is stored in IU’s Scholarly Data Archive (SDA), a tape archive housed at IU Bloomington and Indianapolis in disaster-resistant data centers, with a redesigned file structure which makes efficient and performant use of the replicated tape system. \n\n#### Geospatial Analysis of Fire Incidents in Pittsburgh using SimplyAnalytics \n\n**Charles Swartz, SimplyAnalytics**\n\nIn a five-year period, house fires caused 2,620 deaths and $6.9 billion in property damage (National Fire Protection Association). It can also take just 30 seconds for a small flame to turn into a major blaze (Department of Homeland Security).  Analyzing maps of fire incidents helps researchers gain valuable insights into the causes of fires and can help them understand locations that might be at higher risk for certain fire types. In this presentation, fire incident data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC) has been imported into SimplyAnalytics (a web-based mapping, analytics, and data visualization application with 100,000+ data variables) to use alongside demographic, health, psychographic, and consumer behavior data. Further, researchers can quickly generate reports and visualizations from the underlying data to find correlations or associations in target geographies. Utilizing data from diverse sources can aid local fire departments with community outreach and resource allocation.\n\n:material-clock-time-two-outline: 2:50 - 3:00 CST / 3:50 - 4:00 EST - Break\n\n### Career Panels\n\n:material-clock-time-three-outline: 3:00 - 4:00 CST (4:00 - 5:00 EST)\n\n*Facilitator: Yue Shirley Li, Purdue University*\n\n#### Panel 1: How to Keep Learning After Graduation: Professional Development and Continuing Education in the Spatial Workforce\n\nFor many, the goal of post-secondary education is to successfully enter the workforce in the field of your choosing. However, in an industry like GIS and Spatial where the technology is continually and rapidly changing, how do we keep our skills relevant and how do we learn in meaningful ways? Professional organizations offer many paths to answer these questions. Building networks with other spatial professionals, volunteering within an organization, and structured learning opportunities in the form of conferences and workshops, provide social outlets and skill development for continuous learners. Members of the Vanguard Cabinet discuss what it means to be involved in a professional organization, their impact in our career development, and the programs that we are developing in the Vanguard Cabinet to help other young professionals.\n\nPanelists:\n\n* Sid Pandey (Penn State, University of Maryland)\n* Kate Berg (University of California Los Angeles, University of Michigan)\n* Wanmei Liang (University of California Los Angeles)\n\n#### Panel 2: URISA BIG 10 Alumni Panel \n\nJoin three members of URISA (GIS professional association) who are each Big 10 alumni sharing their geospatial career pathways. Their Big 10 educations set them each on a pathway enabling enabled each of them to gain experience with geospatial technology as it was bursting onto the scene across several disciplines during the 1990’s. Panelists were each educated at Big 10 Universities across a variety of disciplines including: environment and sustainability; forestry; rural sociology and community development and geography. Panelists will speak about their careers in private industry and consulting, academia, and local government.  We will share how our educational experiences at Big 10 universities provided us with an excellent foundation for interdisciplinary exploration using geographic information systems throughout our career paths. Panelists will also emphasize the value of their involvement with geospatial professional associations including our professional development and service through URISA. \n\nPanelists:\n\n* Dr. Steve Steinberg, Geographic Information Officer (GIO) for the County of Los Angeles, California.

Predicting species range in response to variation in climate is a goal shared among the fields of both conservation and evolutionary ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs) are visual representations of simulated spatial and temporal patterns of a species in response to predictor variables (PVs), making them useful tools for predicting a species’ range for extrapolated future climate scenarios. As rapid environmental change is experienced, animals must adapt to changes in their environment at a minimum of the same rate, lest they risk extinction. Range shifts and adjustments in movement strategies are mechanism of coping with climate change, and SDMs give insight into how these mechanisms may play out in natural populations—information that may be used to forecast population dynamics and persistence. A better understanding of where, when, and how species distributions are shaped provides valuable information to conservation practitioners, evolutionary ecologists, and policy makers for decision-making regarding habitat and species management. Here, I use ArcGIS Pro2 software to demonstrate SDMs of climate niches for a common migratory North American songbird, the slate-colored dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), utilizing contemporary and extrapolated climate scenarios to model changes in its range as it experiences climate change.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"2-estimating-urban-rooftop-solar-power-production-potential-in-chicago\">2.

However, it remains a challenging task with traditional remote sensing techniques because of the limit in imaging resolution. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as an emerging RS technique, are getting more attentions for their low-cost and high-resolution advantages. However, most of the studies focusing on UAVs images for tree species identification are based on multispectral, hyperspectral images or combined with LiDAR data. The gap exists in using UAVs RGB data to identify tree species at the stand-level in forests with various species, especially for temperate forests. In this study, we built a  species dataset using high-resolution canopy images (3-5 centimeters)  collected by drones from different seasons. Transfer learning techniques were used to test the performance on specie identification using ResNet18, YOLOv5, and EffcientNetb0, which achieved accuracies above 98% among 4 species including northern red oak, black cherry, and white oak. Testing how flight height affects species classification using RGB images from different flight altitudes is one of the projects we are working on. Tree species identification among more species and individual tree detection from natural forests will be part of our future work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"5-how-would-ses-and-neighborhood-environment-influence-individuals-physical-inactivity-and-psychological-distress-in-the-city-of-chicago\">5.

Previous research has repeatedly found that family socio-economic status is related to individuals’ health through multiple pathways, like nutrition intake, social and emotional functioning, and adoption of health risk behaviors. Meanwhile, community environments, like community crimes, green spaces, and access to public health services, are also important to people’s health. In medical sociology, the interacting effects of social factors on the individual level and resources on the community level on individuals’ health have been explored. However, it usually lacks a view of geography due to the limitation of data or methodology skills. This study aims to apply GIS to the field of medical sociology to better understand the pattern of how health is influenced. The City of Chicago provides resourceful data on health and neighborhood characteristics. I propose to combine the Healthy Chicago Survey on individuals living in poverty and the environmental data regarding green spaces, crimes, race/ethnicity segregation, education, etc. to explore is there is a moderating, say a protective, effect on community/neighborhood level environment on the negative effect of low socioeconomic on individuals’ health outcomes, including physical inactivity and serious psychological distress.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"session-1-justice-and-social-geography\">Session 1: Justice and Social Geography\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#session-1-justice-and-social-geography\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Session 1: Justice and Social Geography”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>:material-clock-time-ten-outline: 10:00 - 11:00 CST (11:00 - 12:00 EST)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"reconstructing-historical-neighborhoods-from-historic-sanborn-maps-using-machine-learning\">Reconstructing Historical Neighborhoods from historic Sanborn Maps Using Machine Learning\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#reconstructing-historical-neighborhoods-from-historic-sanborn-maps-using-machine-learning\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Reconstructing Historical Neighborhoods from historic Sanborn Maps Using Machine Learning”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Harvey Miller, Center for Urban and Regional Analysis / The Ohio State University; Yue Lin, CURA/Ohio State; Ningchuan Xiao, CURA/Ohio State; Gerika Logan, CURA/Ohio State\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The building of the interstate highway system in US cities in the 20th century split and sometimes destroyed entire neighborhoods, mostly those housing African Americans, immigrants and other minorities. Planners of the system routed some highways, often purposely, through vulnerable and deprived neighborhoods occupied by people of color. Once thriving and full neighborhoods, these neighborhoods were split and, in some cases, even fully demolished for these urban highways. This caused an economic downturn in many of these neighborhoods that lasts until the present day. Remaining residents still live with the negative consequences of these highways, including disconnections, poor air quality, noise and road trauma. The Ghost Neighborhoods of Columbus project will highlight these lost and damaged neighborhoods by using machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques to extract building level data from historic Sanborn fire insurance maps to populate a GIS database, allowing 3D visualizations of the lost urban landscapes, and support analysis of the wealth, communities and activities lost to urban highway construction. This presentation will discuss our workflow and show results from Driving Park and Hanford Village in Columbus, Ohio – two neighborhoods damaged by the construction of interstate highway I-70.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"using-maps-to-communicate-the-relationship-between-broadband-and-health\">Using maps to communicate the relationship between broadband and health\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#using-maps-to-communicate-the-relationship-between-broadband-and-health\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Using maps to communicate the relationship between broadband and health”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jess Hoffelder, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute; Anne Roubal, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Broadband was highlighted as a critically important service during the pandemic. Although it is widely documented that internet availability is inconsistent across rural areas, pockets of neighborhoods in urban areas also lack access. We used the example of Milwaukee, Wisconsin a historically segregated city to show how Federally sanctioned residential segregation in the 1930’s is still reflected in health inequities in socioeconomic health metrics today. We used ArcGIS Pro to map several community socioeconomic metrics such as children in poverty, homeownership rates, and those who have completed high school, as well as historically redlined neighborhoods, against access to high-speed broadband to show the spatial patterns. We then transformed these maps into several GIFs, shared in an article on the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps website and social media platforms, to help users better overlay the different metrics. We find, unsurprisingly, that census tracts with lower percentages of broadband access are correlated with those in which more children live in poverty, fewer individuals own their homes or graduated high school, and were more likely to be redlined in the past. These findings highlight the existence of digital redlining and point to the need to reduce the inequity in broadband access to avoid further harm to communities experiencing disinvestment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"overcoming-the-challenges-of-developing-a-geospatial-database-for-longitudinal-study-of-urban-childhood-obesity\">Overcoming the challenges of developing a geospatial database for longitudinal study of urban childhood obesity\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#overcoming-the-challenges-of-developing-a-geospatial-database-for-longitudinal-study-of-urban-childhood-obesity\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Overcoming the challenges of developing a geospatial database for longitudinal study of urban childhood obesity”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>David Tulloch, Rutgers University; Kristen Lloyd, Rutgers University; Michael Yedidia, Rutgers University; Derek Delia, Rutgers University; Robin DeWeese, Arizona State University; Francesco Acciai, Arizona State University; Punam Ohri-Vachaspati, Arizona State University\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Childhood obesity is a complex problem to which a child’s environment contributes significantly. Translating the dynamic urban realities of both the food environment and physical activity (PA) environment into consistently measurable variables is a challenging GIS problem, especially in cities with limited municipal data infrastructure. Using proximity as an indicator of access, we created an unique longitudinal dataset for this project which led to a variety of important findings about childhood obesity and access to parks and corner stores, perceptions about safety impacting walkability, and the value of developing an early habit of walking or biking to school. Since 2008, our research team built a routinely updated database representing the dynamic food environment of Camden, Newark, New Brunswick and Trenton, New Jersey. Updates included mapping corner stores, groceries, fruit and vegetable store, bakeries, butchers, supermarkets, as well as fast-food and full-service restaurants. While general food outlet data is acquired from various sources, to be valid each year’s entry needs to be checked with direct contact and using supplementary information sources (e.g. external locational data). Simultaneously, the team mapped the physical activity environment, including parks and PA facilities (like gyms). The database also includes upgrades to community PA features (like parks, trails), extracting information from city agencies, project grants and other public sources.  This presentation will provide a brief overview of the key contributions of GIS to this 15-year collaboration of multidisciplinary multi-institutional childhood obesity research. It will then focus on the geospatial challenges encountered and lessons learned.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"session-2-climate-and-carbon\">Session 2: Climate and Carbon\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#session-2-climate-and-carbon\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Session 2: Climate and Carbon”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>:material-clock-time-eleven-outline: 11:15 - 12:00 CST (12:15 - 1:00 EST)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Facilitator: Karen Majewicz, University of Minnesota\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"detecting-forest-carbon-storage-by-remote-sensing\">Detecting forest carbon storage by remote sensing\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#detecting-forest-carbon-storage-by-remote-sensing\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Detecting forest carbon storage by remote sensing”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bowen Li, Purdue University; Guofan Shao, Purdue University; Michael Saunders, Purdue University\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Forest is a major contributor in carbon sequestration and reduces impacts from climate change.

Such changes will impact valuable ecosystem services. We developed a model in the urban-coastal Jamaica Bay, New York watershed to quantify present-day carbon sequestration, aboveground carbon storage, and belowground carbon storage ecosystem services and predict the impact of sea level rise through 2100 on future ecosystem services. Due to the disproportional impact of sea level rise on wetlands and natural coastal-fringe habitat, we predicted that carbon sequestration and storage would be significantly impacted in these habitats. Our model projected that future carbon sequestration, aboveground carbon storage, and belowground carbon storage potential in our watershed will have losses up to 0.16%, 15%, and 51%, respectively. We paired our present-day ecosystem service model results with socio-economic data and identified clusters in which mitigation action may help to address impacts of sea level rise and environmental justice. Our work addresses the need for better understanding of urban- coastal ecosystem service flows and the potential impact of future landscape change on environmental and socio-economic factors. Our results provide support for actions to increase urban-coastal resilience through informed design, planning, and management of these ecologically and socially significant landscapes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>:material-clock-time-twelve-outline: 12:00 - 1:00 CST / 1:00 - 2:00 EST - LUNCH BREAK\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"keynote---our-home-on-native-land-connecting-people-and-stories-using-indigenous-geographies\">Keynote - Our Home on Native Land: Connecting People and Stories using Indigenous Geographies\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#keynote---our-home-on-native-land-connecting-people-and-stories-using-indigenous-geographies\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Keynote - Our Home on Native Land: Connecting People and Stories using Indigenous Geographies”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>:material-clock-time-one-outline: 1:00 - 2:00 CST / 2:00 - 3:00 EST\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Facilitator: Joshua Sadvari, Ohio State University\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Tanya Ruka, Native Land Digital\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tanya Te Miringa Te Rorarangi Ruka is a Māori Indigenous artist and designer living in Te Whānganui-a-Tara, Aotearoa (Wellington, Capital City of New Zealand).

The portal includes data from the statewide imagery initiatives since 2005, statewide elevation datasets, NAIP imagery, regional datasets, USGS topographic maps, and Sanborn historic maps. The updates to the ISDP included replacing the existing portal with a new user interface and robust middleware, as well as workflows that ingested new data not previously available in the ISDP. The revised platform continues to rely on IU’s Intelligent Infrastructure for portal and server components and UITS Research Technologies storage and database hosting services for search and data delivery. Data on ISDP is stored in IU’s Scholarly Data Archive (SDA), a tape archive housed at IU Bloomington and Indianapolis in disaster-resistant data centers, with a redesigned file structure which makes efficient and performant use of the replicated tape system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"geospatial-analysis-of-fire-incidents-in-pittsburgh-using-simplyanalytics\">Geospatial Analysis of Fire Incidents in Pittsburgh using SimplyAnalytics\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#geospatial-analysis-of-fire-incidents-in-pittsburgh-using-simplyanalytics\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Geospatial Analysis of Fire Incidents in Pittsburgh using SimplyAnalytics”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Charles Swartz, SimplyAnalytics\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In a five-year period, house fires caused 2,620 deaths and $6.9 billion in property damage (National Fire Protection Association). It can also take just 30 seconds for a small flame to turn into a major blaze (Department of Homeland Security).  Analyzing maps of fire incidents helps researchers gain valuable insights into the causes of fires and can help them understand locations that might be at higher risk for certain fire types. In this presentation, fire incident data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC) has been imported into SimplyAnalytics (a web-based mapping, analytics, and data visualization application with 100,000+ data variables) to use alongside demographic, health, psychographic, and consumer behavior data. Further, researchers can quickly generate reports and visualizations from the underlying data to find correlations or associations in target geographies. Utilizing data from diverse sources can aid local fire departments with community outreach and resource allocation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>:material-clock-time-two-outline: 2:50 - 3:00 CST / 3:50 - 4:00 EST - Break\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"career-panels\">Career Panels\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#career-panels\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Career Panels”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>:material-clock-time-three-outline: 3:00 - 4:00 CST (4:00 - 5:00 EST)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Facilitator: Yue Shirley Li, Purdue University\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"panel-1-how-to-keep-learning-after-graduation-professional-development-and-continuing-education-in-the-spatial-workforce\">Panel 1: How to Keep Learning After Graduation: Professional Development and Continuing Education in the Spatial Workforce\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#panel-1-how-to-keep-learning-after-graduation-professional-development-and-continuing-education-in-the-spatial-workforce\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Panel 1: How to Keep Learning After Graduation: Professional Development and Continuing Education in the Spatial Workforce”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>For many, the goal of post-secondary education is to successfully enter the workforce in the field of your choosing.

Professional organizations offer many paths to answer these questions. Building networks with other spatial professionals, volunteering within an organization, and structured learning opportunities in the form of conferences and workshops, provide social outlets and skill development for continuous learners.

The MSU SWIG group will be hosting trivia in honor of Geography Awareness Week. We'll play two rounds of traditional pub trivia covering a myriad of geography topics and pop culture!\n\n---\n\n### CONCURRENT PRESENTATIONS\n\nFriday, November 13, 2020 10:00 - 11:30 am EST / 9:00 - 10:30 am CST  \n\n#### Humanities and Social Sciences\n\n1. **Shaking Up Small Business: The Impact of Seismic Retrofitting on Small Businesses in 3 San Francisco Supervisor Districts**\n\n    Lauren Ashley Week, University of Michigan, San Francisco Office of Small Business\n\n    In 2013, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors established the Mandatory Seismic Retrofit Program. Requiring all ‘softstory’ buildings – defined as structures with ‘soft’ wall lines – to seismically reinforce their ground floors, the law is an example of proactive environmental resiliency planning. However, the legally sanctioned passthrough of capital improvement costs onto commercial tenants has resulted in an unintended consequence: extreme rent burden. I will spatially analyze the impact of mandatory seismic retrofitting on small businesses across three San Francisco Supervisor Districts: 1, 2, and 5, each of which represent different median income levels for my comparison. I gain further detail on the Program’s impact by comparing commercial census tracts (where clusters of businesses exist) within the districts.\n    \n    ---\n\n2. **Mapping Prejudice: Cartographic Activism and Primary Sources**\n\n    Ryan Mattke, Map & Geospatial Information Librarian and Head of the John R. Borchert Map Library, University of Minnesota\n\t\n    Mapping Prejudice is mobilizing people of all ages and backgrounds to map racial covenants. Racial covenants are legal clauses in property deeds that barred people who were not white from buying or even occupying certain parcels of land. The project has developed an innovative methodology to map these covenants while catalyzing community conversations. The result is a digital, interactive map. The process of making that map ‒ and the dataset that undergirds it ‒ has proven a powerful vehicle for social change. Those who contribute to the map are forced to confront structural racism. Covenants are irrefutable examples of racially discriminatory practices. Engagement with these documents drives participants to identify systems-level solutions to contemporary housing problems. In addition to this mobilization, the map and the dataset are invaluable resources for policymakers and researchers who want to demonstrate how structural racism perpetuates inequalities. This talk will describe the project and its methods, cartographic and otherwise, and the social progress made, so far, toward a more honest future.\n    \n    ---\n\n3. **Homegoing: The Technology of Living Spatial Data and Black Public Mourning in the Age of COVID-19**\n\n    Dr. Kim Gallon, Associate Professor of History, Purdue University\n\n    This project is a spatial visualization of COVID-19 mortality data based on race. It tells the story of systemic inequality and health disparities in the pandemic. However, the map also recovers the humanity of Black Americans who have died from the coronavirus. Overall, the map acts a site of grief and mourning.\n    \n    ---\n\n4. **Twitter Data for Social Science Research**\n\n    Guangqing Chi, Pennsylvania State University\n\n    The skyrocketing growth of social media data provide significant opportunities to study social problems and advance social sciences. In comparison to traditional survey and census-based data collection that is expensive and labor intensive to conduct, Twitter offers one of the newest, most rapidly growing, and accessible Big Data streams and has drawn interest from disciplines such as computer science, transportation planning, urban studies, public health, and behavioral science. As the data are generated from a massive group of individuals across the globe in real time, Twitter data have great potential for understanding various population dynamics. However, as evidenced in many existing studies, the use of Twitter data suffers from their mis-representativeness of the population and we know little about the characteristics of the users, such as the composition of demographic and complex user behaviors. This presentation will introduce Twitter data, evaluate their biases, discuss the usefulness of Twitter data for social science research, and introduce the Twitter data resources and capacity at the Computational and Spatial Analysis Core of the Pennsylvania State University. \n    \n    ---\n\n\n#### Agriculture and Natural Sciences\n\n1. **Understanding the Disturbance of Human Recreation on Wildlife using Multiple Dynamic Agents within an IBM Framework**\n\n    Soraida Garcia, Purdue University\n    \n    Human recreation within outdoor landscapes is growing, and the extent and intensity of the impact of such activities upon the wildlife are increasing. The presence of humans may increase risk averse behavior by wildlife, restricting the access of wildlife to essential resources. Understanding the impacts of recreating humans upon wildlife is a complex challenge that is dependent upon the wildlife species and human activity types. This can be improved by combining results from empirical studies with simulation models to extrapolate mechanisms and investigate their implications. We developed an IBM modeling framework, that enables both dynamic virtual human and wildlife agents to change their actions based upon their state as a consequence of their interactions with their environment and other virtual agents. We use this framework to model the disturbance of birds, in the Lawrence Creek Forest Unit (LCFU), IN, by human recreation. We parameterize the model with human recreation data collected through an intercept survey of recreationists and bird data from published studies. By incorporating GIS mapping, we are able to simulate various scenarios of alternative trail spatial configurations. Our results indicate that birders influence the rates of disturbance of birds and the energy provided to nesting birds. Interestingly, simulations with imposed static human behavior rather than dynamic human agents estimated a much lower impact of birders on the disturbance of birds. This comparison illustrates the value of simulating human and wildlife agents in dynamic ways and demonstrates a better approach to understanding the conflicts between human recreation and wildlife.\n    \n    ---\n    \n2. **Deforestation in the Agricultural Landscape: Impacts on Water Quality in Indiana**\n\n    Shourish Chakravarty, Yangyang Wang, Mo Zhou, Purdue University\n\n    Indiana is primarily an agricultural state with about half of its land utilized for growing crops, mostly in the northern region. High concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticide residues due to agricultural runoff not only deteriorate the quality of surface and ground water within the state, but also contribute to pollutions as far as in the Gulf of Mexico. Forests in this intensive agricultural landscape, therefore, play a pivotal role in reducing runoff and purifying water, especially in areas with high hydrogeologic and aquifer sensitivity. In this study, we quantified changes in forest cover between 2008 and 2018 in Indiana and estimated their impacts on water quality. Cropland Data Layer, a crop-specific land cover data based on satellite imagery and ground truth, was used to obtain information of land use change for the study region. It is found that although the total forest area has remained relatively unchanged, there have been some significant reductions in forest cover around farmlands in the north. We applied the InVEST Water Purification Nutrient Retention model to estimate the impacts on water purification attributed to such changes. The model used, in addition to the land cover data, other geospatial datasets and user-defined nutrient export and filtration coefficients to estimate pixel-level nutrient export and retention magnitudes. They were then aggregated to 10-digit watershed boundaries, enclosed within Indiana.\n    \n    ---\n\n3. **Assessing soybean stands with sUAS**\n\n    Richard, M, Smith, Shaun Casteel, Purdue University\n\n    An economically important task to be completed shortly after soybean emergence is to ensure that there is an adequate plant population to obtain a profitable grain yield. Early detection of poor emergence and replanting decisions are critical for maximizing profit because grain yield decreases as planting is delayed. The objective of this research is to determine the ability of sUAS to assess soybean emergence as it relates to optimal plant population and growth stage. Large-scale field studies (~20 ha) were established at 4 locations in Indiana. Two commercially popular varieties of soybean with differing relative maturity were planted at 5 seeding rates (123,500, 247,000, 370,000, 494,000, 617,500 seeds ha-1). These treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 3 to 5 replications. Aerial imagery was collected at two altitudes with a RGB (red, green, blue) camera equipped to a sUAS at multiple stages throughout the crops vegetative growth. Targeted sampling locations were selected using LiDAR derived terrain maps. Targeted sample imagery was collected at low altitude (\u003C 22 m), where transects were flown perpendicular to the plot direction, collecting subsamples (4 to 5 images) of each plot. These images were co-registered to whole-field orthomosaics which were constructed from high altitude flights (>75 m). Each target subsample location was ground referenced to determine actual plant population. Imagery of locations with known plant populations were subjected to processing then used for comparing canopy coverage values from low altitude (\u003C22 m) and greater altitude (>75 m) aerial imagery to evaluate the importance of spatial resolution in assessing soybean plant population with a RGB sensor. \n    \n    ---\n\n5. **Development of soil and land cover databases for hydrologic modeling in Arequipa, Peru**\n\n    Fariborz Daneshvar, Jane Frankenberger, Laura Bowling, Keith Cherkauer, Johann Alexander Vera Mercado,  Purdue University\nMartin Juan C. Villalta Soto, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin\n\n    Spatially complete GIS data sets of land cover and soil properties are needed to effectively run hydrologic models such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). However, data suitable for SWAT simulations, which requires a detailed set of properties by layer for the entire area of interest, are not readily available in many regions around the world. In this study, GIS maps and databases needed for the ArcSWAT, the ArcGIS interface of SWAT, were developed for the Peruvian Andes region. Soil maps that lacked detailed layer-based properties were combined with point soil profile information in an innovative method that defined soil classes based on a combination of two maps of soil taxonomy and suitability. Through this process, 172 soil classes were mapped, with 15 properties set for each class. For the land cover dataset, maps of land cover exist for the region, but required properties based on Andes vegetation were not available. Therefore regional climate maps and remotely sensed satellite data were used to estimate parameters such as the maximum leaf area index that controls the seasonal cycle of local vegetation. Spatially complete GIS data for estimated physical properties of soil and land cover classes will be posted on the Purdue University Research Repository (PURR) as a freely available resource to support hydrologic modeling in Arequipa, Peru. \n    \n    ---\n\n#### GIS Infrastructure\n\n1. **A quick tour of our Nation's Geodetic Infrastructure**\n\n    Jeff Jalbrzikowski, Ohio State University\n\n    Join the National Geodetic Survey’s (NGS) Appalachian Regional Advisor Jeff Jalbrzikowski, P.S., GISP, CFS, as he provides a glimpse into our nation’s geodetic infrastructure, the framework that makes efficient GIS analysis possible. Jeff will review NAD83 and NAVD88, along with NGS’s plans to replace them both with new datums in a few years, and discuss some of the other elements of the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS).\n    \n    ---\n    \n2. **GIS in Interesting Times: An ArcGIS Enterprise Deployment by Purdue University Physical Facilities**\n\n    Anna C Burman, Angela Slocum, Mark Hickman, Dean Romack, Purdue University\n\n    Purdue’s Physical Facilities deployed ArcGIS Enterprise beginning in April 2020. Campus disruptions from COVID-19 forced us to pivot quickly to a remote installation. The learning curve associated with that pivot illustrated where our planning went well and where we needed to improve. GIS has a two decade history at Purdue Facilities. GIS platforms have ranged from Bentley Geographics to ESRI ArcMap. Support and approval to move to ArcGIS Enterprise required collaboration with our IT partners and senior leadership to complete a return on investment (ROI) exercise and project charter. The outcomes of both set our project priorities and expectations. That focus allowed us to identify specific potential cost savings. Since deployment, ROI priorities and the project charter continue to lead development. Our primary objectives are improving data management, GIS content accessibility and reducing technical debt. As a result, we provide more efficient and effective stewardship of facilities assets. Our analysts have been working since July 2020 to build our ArcGIS Portal, create and manage Portal user groups, and create content and resources for the campus community. They serve as de facto educational and PR contacts for our growing number of users while furthering ongoing campus operations. Purdue University is Indiana’s land grant university. The work we do maintains its lands, facilities and infrastructure. Thorough planning enabled us to support Purdue’s needs in unprecedented circumstances. The process has been exhilarating and a privilege.\n    \n    ---\n\n3. **Campus Waste Map - A Web of Connections**\n\n    Travis Blomberg, University Of Wisconsin - Madison \n\n    Time's running out on UW-Madison to reach its zero waste goal. To accelerate UW-Madison's efforts, the Office of Sustainability created a living \"Campus Waste Map\" with its Waste & Recycling division in order to manage its material collection assets, optimize route collection, and inform campus decision makers. Armed with smartphones and the ArcGIS Collector app, the field team pinpointed the location of various types collection containers and inputted data into the nearly 30 fields. The data from Collector is synced to the ArcGIS Online Map.  The Waste & Recycling division adopted this platform to utilize and operationalize its campus collection efforts. Managerially, this map provides new insight into communication efforts to support the zero waste mission. \n    \n    ---\n\n4. **Dimensions of Poverty in Midwestern States**\n\n    Andrey V. Zhalnin, Lionel J. Beaulieu, Indraneel Kumar, Benjamin St. Germain, Center for Regional Development, Purdue University\nYong J. Kim, Korea Environment Institute\n\n    In our presentation, we demonstrate the GIS application of a collaborative research effort by the Purdue University’s Center for Regional Development and Department of Agricultural Economics, and USDA’s Economic Research Service. The project studied individual, family, and neighborhood characteristics that enabled households to come out of the poverty trap. The research needed temporal data on poverty and socioeconomic characteristics that were spatially harmonized to account for changes in the sub-county geographies since 1970s. \n    The Purdue research team used crosswalks developed by Brown University and filled-in the spatial data for un-tracted rural areas for 1970 and 1980 to develop a consistent GIS database for five decades. This effort resulted in approximately 72,000 spatially harmonized tracts in the U.S., and 17,000 tracts across the 12 states of the North Central Region for the 1970-2016 time period.\n    The “Dimensions of Poverty” interactive website – comprised of charts and maps –serves 12 states that comprise the North Central Region. The story map presents key demographic and economic data including harmonized poverty variables and displays areas of high and persistent poverty in the region. \nThe web-based reports analyze three dimensions of poverty (high poverty, persistent poverty and child poverty) and present data in concise and visually rich way. The Story Map is being explored by various federal, state, and regional agencies in Indiana and beyond to make informed decisions pertaining to economic development.\n\n---\n\n### BREAK\n\n11:30 - 11:50 EST / 10:30 - 10:50 CST\n\n---\n\n### LIGHTNING TALKS\n\n11:50 - 12:30 EST / 10:50 - 11:30 CST\n\n 1. **What is geodesy and why is it important to you?** \n\n    Jeff Jalbrzikowski, Ohio State University\n\n    Join the National Geodetic Survey’s (NGS) Appalachian Regional Advisor Jeff Jalbrzikowski, P.S., GISP, CFS, for a lightning talk on geodesy and why utilizing modern datums is important for all geospatial professionals.\n    \n    ---\n\n2. **Impact of Emerald Ash Borer and Forest Structure on Understory Plant Invasion**\n\n    Jessica M. Elliott, Elizabeth LaRue, Songlin Fei, Purdue University; Joey Gallion, Indiana Department of Natural Resources\n\n    As the impact of insect pests, invasive shrubs and habitat fragmentation continues to grow, so too does the need for a comprehensive method of characterizing the health of Indiana forests. My research takes advantage of GIS, remote sensing, and Big Data to address a critical environmental issue. More specifically, I utilize a combination of ArcGIS mapping software, aerial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and Continuous Forest Inventory (CFI) ground data to assess the potential impacts of Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis) and forest structure on understory plant invasion. ArcGIS allowed for the selection and visualization of forest ash (Fraxinus spp.) plots across Indiana, and along with statewide continuous LiDAR and plot level CFI data, I created a comprehensive image of the forested landscape. My preliminary results illustrated that taller and more heterogeneous canopies are related to lower invasive species richness and potentially show some degree of biotic resistance. Future research will focus on using the spatial capabilities offered by ArcGIS in tandem with the quantitative analyses that can be performed with LiDAR and CFI metrics to detect landscape-level invasive response. Unique structural changes can be measured with the two LiDAR time points with the goal of enhancing our understanding of the way invasion can alter or be altered by the spatial arrangement of a canopy. \n    \n    ---\n\n3. **Geospatial analysis of light pollution and house vacancy during the COVID-19 outbreak**\n\n    Qing Su, Jie Shan, Purdue University\n\n    The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused various socioeconomic changes in the country, especially in metropolitan cities. One effective information source that can reveal such changes is the NASA nighttime light (NTL) data product that has daily update at a spatial resolution of 500 m. This study uses the seasonal-trend-decomposition procedure to analyze the light pollution time series deviations in Chicago. Another utility of NTL data product is the calculation of house vacancy rate (HVR) in combination with land cover data. The estimated HVR is compared with the statistical HVR data from US Census Bureau for validation. Through this study, we found out that the light pollution change since COVID-19 outbreak was successfully modeled by the seasonal-trend-decomposition procedure and the estimated HVR was strongly correlated with the Census statistical data before and after the outbreak. Such results reflect the overall decreased trend of light pollution generated by less human nocturnal activities, due to the stay-at-home order. In Chicago, the light pollution increases during the first two months of 2020 (up to 15.3% in the same month compared with 2019), but sharply decreases in March (12% decrease in the same month compared with 2019), and slightly goes up in the second quarter. Also, the residential real estate market at a metropolitan city level is less energetic due to COVID-19.\n    \n    ---\n\n4. **Managing GIS student engagement projects: a sustainable approach**\n\n    Tara Anthony, Penn State University\n\n    This talk will focus on geospatial project management aspects helpful for working remotely with undergraduate student employees. Aspects of geospatial projects regarding planning, communication, and organization will be highlighted for application to other settings, such as research units, group projects, and/or internship/employment opportunities. Examples are from the Donald W. Hamer Center for Maps and Geospatial Information at Penn State University Libraries.\n    \n    ---\n\n5. **Using cell phone data to track social distancing during COVID-19 pandemic: the case of Chicago**\n\n    Yujia Zhu, Jie Shan, Purdue University\n\n    Since the coronavirus pandemic began spreading across the US, government and public health officials have implemented social distancing guidelines to reduce the rate of infection. As the pandemic rages on, publicly available cell phone data is being used to analyze how practicing social distancing indicates the rise and spread of COVID-19. This research uses SafeGraph publicly available cell phone data to show the trends of social activities in the City of Chicago. By visualizing and spatial analyzing the social distancing trends of different regions in Chicago and the growth of COVID-19 positive cases, the associations between these two are found and discussed.\n    \n    ---\n\n6. **Building Apps for Equity and Social Justice: Mapping the Black Lives Matter Movement**\n\n    Frank Romo, University of Michigan\n\n    Mapping the Black Lives Matter Movment is our team’s attempt to document this historic moment and engage with users on a personal level to advance the conversation of race and policing in this country. This project is one part of a larger engaged research project by RomoGIS entitled Race and Policing in America which examines how people of color and entire communities are affected by over-policing, criminalization and mass incarceration. The goal of this project is to highlight the power of our communities and demonstrate the collective power we have to overcome injustice. Our team hopes to continue developing this product and create new applications in the coming months that will address key issues in our communities and provide activists with additional resources in their fight for justice. The newly released BLM-Map includes data of over 4,000 protests locations, over 100 contested statue locations, and almost 100 new BLM murals around the world making it one of the most comprehensive maps of the Black Lives Matter movement to date. This presentation will discuss how we crowdsourced data and built tools to create a real-time application documenting the various protests and demonstrations across the country. \n    \n    ---\n\n### LUNCH\n12:30 – 2:00 EST / 11:30 - 1:00 CST\n\n---\n\n### KEYNOTE: Spatial Data Science: Turning Big Spatial Data to Timely Action. \n\n2:00 - 3:20 pm EST / 1:00 - 2:20 pm CST\n\nSpace and time are essential dimensions for a wide spectrum of challenges we face, ranging from redesigning health infrastructure during pandemics to driving precision agriculture under climate change. Modern developments in GIS can integrate vast amounts and types of space-time data, enabling an interconnected nervous system for our planet. The increased quantity and diversity of data sources pose both challenges and opportunities for this connection. Harnessing the power of this nervous system requires connecting it to intelligent systems that can reveal critical patterns and relationships to guide decisions that shape our future. Spatial data science paves the path for multidisciplinary spatial problem solving to transform big spatial data into deep understanding with modern spatial machine learning. Spatial data science is essential for sophisticated to understand “the where” and the “the when” to make decisions about “the how”. ESRI's platform fuses state-of-the-art GIS technologies for mapping and spatial analysis with established open-source technologies. This keynote will showcase components of modern GIS as the central system for understanding our planet. Components of the ESRI ecosystem will be elaborated for ways in which it can be utilized for large scale spatial data science.\n\n\n**Dr. Orhun Aydin, Senior Researcher, Esri**\n\nOrhun Aydin is a senior researcher in ESRI's Spatial Statistics team and a Lecturer in the Spatial Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California.

Requiring all ‘softstory’ buildings – defined as structures with ‘soft’ wall lines – to seismically reinforce their ground floors, the law is an example of proactive environmental resiliency planning. However, the legally sanctioned passthrough of capital improvement costs onto commercial tenants has resulted in an unintended consequence: extreme rent burden. I will spatially analyze the impact of mandatory seismic retrofitting on small businesses across three San Francisco Supervisor Districts: 1, 2, and 5, each of which represent different median income levels for my comparison. I gain further detail on the Program’s impact by comparing commercial census tracts (where clusters of businesses exist) within the districts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Mapping Prejudice: Cartographic Activism and Primary Sources\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ryan Mattke, Map &#x26; Geospatial Information Librarian and Head of the John R.

Racial covenants are legal clauses in property deeds that barred people who were not white from buying or even occupying certain parcels of land. The project has developed an innovative methodology to map these covenants while catalyzing community conversations. The result is a digital, interactive map. The process of making that map ‒ and the dataset that undergirds it ‒ has proven a powerful vehicle for social change. Those who contribute to the map are forced to confront structural racism. Covenants are irrefutable examples of racially discriminatory practices. Engagement with these documents drives participants to identify systems-level solutions to contemporary housing problems. In addition to this mobilization, the map and the dataset are invaluable resources for policymakers and researchers who want to demonstrate how structural racism perpetuates inequalities. This talk will describe the project and its methods, cartographic and otherwise, and the social progress made, so far, toward a more honest future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Homegoing: The Technology of Living Spatial Data and Black Public Mourning in the Age of COVID-19\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dr. Kim Gallon, Associate Professor of History, Purdue University\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This project is a spatial visualization of COVID-19 mortality data based on race.

In comparison to traditional survey and census-based data collection that is expensive and labor intensive to conduct, Twitter offers one of the newest, most rapidly growing, and accessible Big Data streams and has drawn interest from disciplines such as computer science, transportation planning, urban studies, public health, and behavioral science. As the data are generated from a massive group of individuals across the globe in real time, Twitter data have great potential for understanding various population dynamics. However, as evidenced in many existing studies, the use of Twitter data suffers from their mis-representativeness of the population and we know little about the characteristics of the users, such as the composition of demographic and complex user behaviors. This presentation will introduce Twitter data, evaluate their biases, discuss the usefulness of Twitter data for social science research, and introduce the Twitter data resources and capacity at the Computational and Spatial Analysis Core of the Pennsylvania State University.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"agriculture-and-natural-sciences\">Agriculture and Natural Sciences\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#agriculture-and-natural-sciences\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Agriculture and Natural Sciences”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Understanding the Disturbance of Human Recreation on Wildlife using Multiple Dynamic Agents within an IBM Framework\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Soraida Garcia, Purdue University\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Human recreation within outdoor landscapes is growing, and the extent and intensity of the impact of such activities upon the wildlife are increasing. The presence of humans may increase risk averse behavior by wildlife, restricting the access of wildlife to essential resources. Understanding the impacts of recreating humans upon wildlife is a complex challenge that is dependent upon the wildlife species and human activity types. This can be improved by combining results from empirical studies with simulation models to extrapolate mechanisms and investigate their implications. We developed an IBM modeling framework, that enables both dynamic virtual human and wildlife agents to change their actions based upon their state as a consequence of their interactions with their environment and other virtual agents. We use this framework to model the disturbance of birds, in the Lawrence Creek Forest Unit (LCFU), IN, by human recreation. We parameterize the model with human recreation data collected through an intercept survey of recreationists and bird data from published studies. By incorporating GIS mapping, we are able to simulate various scenarios of alternative trail spatial configurations. Our results indicate that birders influence the rates of disturbance of birds and the energy provided to nesting birds. Interestingly, simulations with imposed static human behavior rather than dynamic human agents estimated a much lower impact of birders on the disturbance of birds. This comparison illustrates the value of simulating human and wildlife agents in dynamic ways and demonstrates a better approach to understanding the conflicts between human recreation and wildlife.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Deforestation in the Agricultural Landscape: Impacts on Water Quality in Indiana\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Shourish Chakravarty, Yangyang Wang, Mo Zhou, Purdue University\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Indiana is primarily an agricultural state with about half of its land utilized for growing crops, mostly in the northern region. High concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticide residues due to agricultural runoff not only deteriorate the quality of surface and ground water within the state, but also contribute to pollutions as far as in the Gulf of Mexico. Forests in this intensive agricultural landscape, therefore, play a pivotal role in reducing runoff and purifying water, especially in areas with high hydrogeologic and aquifer sensitivity. In this study, we quantified changes in forest cover between 2008 and 2018 in Indiana and estimated their impacts on water quality. Cropland Data Layer, a crop-specific land cover data based on satellite imagery and ground truth, was used to obtain information of land use change for the study region. It is found that although the total forest area has remained relatively unchanged, there have been some significant reductions in forest cover around farmlands in the north. We applied the InVEST Water Purification Nutrient Retention model to estimate the impacts on water purification attributed to such changes. The model used, in addition to the land cover data, other geospatial datasets and user-defined nutrient export and filtration coefficients to estimate pixel-level nutrient export and retention magnitudes. They were then aggregated to 10-digit watershed boundaries, enclosed within Indiana.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Assessing soybean stands with sUAS\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Richard, M, Smith, Shaun Casteel, Purdue University\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>An economically important task to be completed shortly after soybean emergence is to ensure that there is an adequate plant population to obtain a profitable grain yield. Early detection of poor emergence and replanting decisions are critical for maximizing profit because grain yield decreases as planting is delayed. The objective of this research is to determine the ability of sUAS to assess soybean emergence as it relates to optimal plant population and growth stage. Large-scale field studies (~20 ha) were established at 4 locations in Indiana. Two commercially popular varieties of soybean with differing relative maturity were planted at 5 seeding rates (123,500, 247,000, 370,000, 494,000, 617,500 seeds ha-1). These treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 3 to 5 replications. Aerial imagery was collected at two altitudes with a RGB (red, green, blue) camera equipped to a sUAS at multiple stages throughout the crops vegetative growth. Targeted sampling locations were selected using LiDAR derived terrain maps. Targeted sample imagery was collected at low altitude (&#x3C; 22 m), where transects were flown perpendicular to the plot direction, collecting subsamples (4 to 5 images) of each plot. These images were co-registered to whole-field orthomosaics which were constructed from high altitude flights (>75 m). Each target subsample location was ground referenced to determine actual plant population. Imagery of locations with known plant populations were subjected to processing then used for comparing canopy coverage values from low altitude (&#x3C;22 m) and greater altitude (>75 m) aerial imagery to evaluate the importance of spatial resolution in assessing soybean plant population with a RGB sensor.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Development of soil and land cover databases for hydrologic modeling in Arequipa, Peru\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fariborz Daneshvar, Jane Frankenberger, Laura Bowling, Keith Cherkauer, Johann Alexander Vera Mercado,  Purdue University\nMartin Juan C. Villalta Soto, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Spatially complete GIS data sets of land cover and soil properties are needed to effectively run hydrologic models such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). However, data suitable for SWAT simulations, which requires a detailed set of properties by layer for the entire area of interest, are not readily available in many regions around the world. In this study, GIS maps and databases needed for the ArcSWAT, the ArcGIS interface of SWAT, were developed for the Peruvian Andes region. Soil maps that lacked detailed layer-based properties were combined with point soil profile information in an innovative method that defined soil classes based on a combination of two maps of soil taxonomy and suitability. Through this process, 172 soil classes were mapped, with 15 properties set for each class. For the land cover dataset, maps of land cover exist for the region, but required properties based on Andes vegetation were not available. Therefore regional climate maps and remotely sensed satellite data were used to estimate parameters such as the maximum leaf area index that controls the seasonal cycle of local vegetation. Spatially complete GIS data for estimated physical properties of soil and land cover classes will be posted on the Purdue University Research Repository (PURR) as a freely available resource to support hydrologic modeling in Arequipa, Peru.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"gis-infrastructure\">GIS Infrastructure\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#gis-infrastructure\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “GIS Infrastructure”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>A quick tour of our Nation’s Geodetic Infrastructure\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Jeff Jalbrzikowski, Ohio State University\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Join the National Geodetic Survey’s (NGS) Appalachian Regional Advisor Jeff Jalbrzikowski, P.S., GISP, CFS, as he provides a glimpse into our nation’s geodetic infrastructure, the framework that makes efficient GIS analysis possible.

Campus disruptions from COVID-19 forced us to pivot quickly to a remote installation. The learning curve associated with that pivot illustrated where our planning went well and where we needed to improve. GIS has a two decade history at Purdue Facilities. GIS platforms have ranged from Bentley Geographics to ESRI ArcMap. Support and approval to move to ArcGIS Enterprise required collaboration with our IT partners and senior leadership to complete a return on investment (ROI) exercise and project charter. The outcomes of both set our project priorities and expectations. That focus allowed us to identify specific potential cost savings. Since deployment, ROI priorities and the project charter continue to lead development. Our primary objectives are improving data management, GIS content accessibility and reducing technical debt. As a result, we provide more efficient and effective stewardship of facilities assets. Our analysts have been working since July 2020 to build our ArcGIS Portal, create and manage Portal user groups, and create content and resources for the campus community. They serve as de facto educational and PR contacts for our growing number of users while furthering ongoing campus operations. Purdue University is Indiana’s land grant university. The work we do maintains its lands, facilities and infrastructure. Thorough planning enabled us to support Purdue’s needs in unprecedented circumstances. The process has been exhilarating and a privilege.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Campus Waste Map - A Web of Connections\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Travis Blomberg, University Of Wisconsin - Madison\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Time’s running out on UW-Madison to reach its zero waste goal.

The project studied individual, family, and neighborhood characteristics that enabled households to come out of the poverty trap. The research needed temporal data on poverty and socioeconomic characteristics that were spatially harmonized to account for changes in the sub-county geographies since 1970s.\nThe Purdue research team used crosswalks developed by Brown University and filled-in the spatial data for un-tracted rural areas for 1970 and 1980 to develop a consistent GIS database for five decades. This effort resulted in approximately 72,000 spatially harmonized tracts in the U.S., and 17,000 tracts across the 12 states of the North Central Region for the 1970-2016 time period.\nThe “Dimensions of Poverty” interactive website – comprised of charts and maps –serves 12 states that comprise the North Central Region. The story map presents key demographic and economic data including harmonized poverty variables and displays areas of high and persistent poverty in the region.\nThe web-based reports analyze three dimensions of poverty (high poverty, persistent poverty and child poverty) and present data in concise and visually rich way. The Story Map is being explored by various federal, state, and regional agencies in Indiana and beyond to make informed decisions pertaining to economic development.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"break\">BREAK\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#break\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “BREAK”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>11:30 - 11:50 EST / 10:30 - 10:50 CST\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"lightning-talks\">LIGHTNING TALKS\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#lightning-talks\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “LIGHTNING TALKS”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>11:50 - 12:30 EST / 10:50 - 11:30 CST\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>What is geodesy and why is it important to you?\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Jeff Jalbrzikowski, Ohio State University\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Join the National Geodetic Survey’s (NGS) Appalachian Regional Advisor Jeff Jalbrzikowski, P.S., GISP, CFS, for a lightning talk on geodesy and why utilizing modern datums is important for all geospatial professionals.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Impact of Emerald Ash Borer and Forest Structure on Understory Plant Invasion\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Jessica M.

My research takes advantage of GIS, remote sensing, and Big Data to address a critical environmental issue. More specifically, I utilize a combination of ArcGIS mapping software, aerial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and Continuous Forest Inventory (CFI) ground data to assess the potential impacts of Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis) and forest structure on understory plant invasion. ArcGIS allowed for the selection and visualization of forest ash (Fraxinus spp.) plots across Indiana, and along with statewide continuous LiDAR and plot level CFI data, I created a comprehensive image of the forested landscape. My preliminary results illustrated that taller and more heterogeneous canopies are related to lower invasive species richness and potentially show some degree of biotic resistance. Future research will focus on using the spatial capabilities offered by ArcGIS in tandem with the quantitative analyses that can be performed with LiDAR and CFI metrics to detect landscape-level invasive response. Unique structural changes can be measured with the two LiDAR time points with the goal of enhancing our understanding of the way invasion can alter or be altered by the spatial arrangement of a canopy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Geospatial analysis of light pollution and house vacancy during the COVID-19 outbreak\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Qing Su, Jie Shan, Purdue University\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused various socioeconomic changes in the country, especially in metropolitan cities. One effective information source that can reveal such changes is the NASA nighttime light (NTL) data product that has daily update at a spatial resolution of 500 m. This study uses the seasonal-trend-decomposition procedure to analyze the light pollution time series deviations in Chicago. Another utility of NTL data product is the calculation of house vacancy rate (HVR) in combination with land cover data. The estimated HVR is compared with the statistical HVR data from US Census Bureau for validation. Through this study, we found out that the light pollution change since COVID-19 outbreak was successfully modeled by the seasonal-trend-decomposition procedure and the estimated HVR was strongly correlated with the Census statistical data before and after the outbreak. Such results reflect the overall decreased trend of light pollution generated by less human nocturnal activities, due to the stay-at-home order. In Chicago, the light pollution increases during the first two months of 2020 (up to 15.3% in the same month compared with 2019), but sharply decreases in March (12% decrease in the same month compared with 2019), and slightly goes up in the second quarter.

The project’s main output is the [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org/), which serves as a platform through which participating libraries can share materials from their collections to make them more easily discoverable and accessible to varied user communities. Collections within the Geoportal primarily support the research, teaching, learning, and information needs of faculty, staff, and students at participating institutions and beyond.\n\n \n\nThe project supports the creation and aggregation of discovery-focused metadata describing geospatial resources from participating institutions and public sources across the Big Ten region and makes those resources discoverable via an open source portal. \n\n\n## Summary of Collection Scope\n\nAccess to the BTAA Geoportal is open to all. This collection consists of geospatial resources relevant to all disciplines. Access to resources is curated based on their authoritativeness, currency, comprehensiveness, ease of use, and relevancy. Materials included are generally publicly available geospatial datasets (vector/raster), scanned maps (georeferenced or with bounding box coordinates), and aerial imagery. Scanned maps protected by copyright are not included in the Geoportal. Access to licensed resources may be restricted to users affiliated with a participating institution.\n\n\n1. Geographic areas: Items in the collection vary in scale based on subject and range from global to local. Geographic areas vary based on subject and may refer to biomes/ecosystems, political boundaries, cultural boundaries, economic boundaries, or land use types. In addition to a geographic focus on the Big Ten region (i.e., the states where participating institutions are located), the collection will emphasize resources and topics relevant to faculty and student research interests and reflect the strengths of participating library collections.\n2. Time periods: All time periods are collected, with an ability to accommodate both current and historical versions of datasets.\n3. Format: The collection consists of geospatial datasets, georeferenced maps, scanned maps with bounding box coordinates, and aerial imagery. Records for web mapping applications may also be included, with priority given to applications with datasets that are also accessible for download through the Geoportal. Preference is given to open and open source formats, but other formats are accepted as required to facilitate ease of use. When possible, resources are presented in formats that allow for download capabilities. Additional software may be needed to view datasets after download.\n4. Language(s): The collection primarily consists of English language content. Some non-English language content may be available for certain regions, reflecting the collection strengths and research/curricular interests of participating institutions.\n5. Diversity: The Geoportal and its participating institutions aspire to collect and provide access to geospatial resources that represent diverse perspectives, abilities, and experience levels. We will strive to apply [best practices for diverse collection development](https://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/interpretations/diversecollections) as they relate to geospatial resources, including but not limited to:\n    1. considering resources from small, independent, and local producers\n    2. seeking content created by and representative of marginalized and underrepresented groups.\n6. Preservation and life cycle: Digital file preservation for discovery metadata is managed by BTAA Geoportal staff. Digital file preservation for resources is the responsibility of the content provider. Resources may cease to be accessible through the Geoportal if access from the original provider is no longer available.\n\n\n## Statement of Communication\n\nThe members of the Geoportal project team will continue to communicate with the creators of other geoportals (GeoBlacklight Community, etc.), with data providers in our respective regions, and across Big Ten institutions to build a comprehensive and robust collection.\n\nImplementation and Revision Schedule: This policy will be reviewed annually by the Collection Development & Education Outreach Committee and is considered effective on the date indicated below. It will be revised as needed to reflect new collection needs and identify new areas of study as well as those areas that may be excluded.\n\nUpdated: April 27, 2022","src/content/docs/policies/collection-development.md","dff95da05462f744",{"html":504,"metadata":505},"\u003Cp>Authors: BTAA Collection Development &#x26; Education Outreach Committee\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>2021\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"purpose\">Purpose\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#purpose\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Purpose”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>The BTAA Geospatial Information Network is a collaborative project to enhance discoverability, facilitate access, and connect scholars across the Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) to scanned maps, geospatial data, and aerial imagery resources.

These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\n### Directly occupied land\n\nThe institutions in the BTAA-GIN are physically located in the present-day states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. This region is the homeland of numerous tribes throughout history and today. Visit [Native Land Digital](https://native-land.ca) to view maps of Indigenous territories, treaties, and languages across the world.\n\n### Seized and sold land\n\nTen of our fourteen member institutions are land grant public universities that were established through the Morrill Act. These institutions were endowed directly from the profits generated from the forced dispossession and sale of Indigenous land in geographically disparate locations across the nation. [Visit Land Grab Universities](https://www.landgrabu.org) to learn more about this history.\n\n### Maps and geospatial data as tools for dispossession and erasure\n\nThe collections in the BTAA Geoportal contain historical maps, many of which were created or used to make possible the identification, sale, and distribution of ill-gotten land. Furthermore, most of the maps and data included in the collection describe places from a colonial perspective, contributing to the erasure of indigenous names and meaning.

browser.\n\n## Background\n\nGeoreferencing is the process of using ground control points to match a digital image to the geography of the real world. [Allmaps](https://allmaps.org/) is an online tool for georeferencing and overlaying any map that follows [IIIF standards](https://iiif.io/). This allows historical maps and other scanned resources to be displayed and understood in their geographic context. \n\nThe BTAA-GIN Geoportal has an integrated Allmaps plugin that enables users to easily georeference compatible maps and view them as overlays on a basemap without leaving the browser. To view images that have or could have a georeferenced map overlay, expand the **Map Overlay** filter in the left sidebar of a [Geoportal search](https://geo.btaa.org/?search_field=all_fields&q=).\n\nImportant: Georeferenced browser overlays created with Allmaps are currently not available for download as GeoTIFF files, although this functionality may be available at some point in the future. Resources that include downloadable georeferenced GeoTIFFs can be found under the **Downloadable GeoTIFF** filter. Although both GeoTIFFs and Allmaps overlays use ground control points to georeference a map, the Allmaps overlays are primarily suitable for display, while GeoTIFFs are more suitable for GIS analysis.\n\n## Georeference a Map with Allmaps\n\nAnyone can contribute to our collection of georeferenced map overlays.\n\n1. Visit the [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org/), leave the search bar blank or enter keywords of your choice, and click the **Search** button.\n2. Scroll down and expand the **Map Overlay** filter. Click on **False** to view all maps that are compatible with Allmaps (have a IIIF manifest) but have not yet been georeferenced. \n3. Choose a map from the results and visit its resource page. Note that you will need to be able to identify at least some geographic features in the image in order to create a useful overlay. \n4. Click **Georeference this item** under **Map Overlay** in the right sidebar. The Allmaps Editor will open in a new browser tab.\n5. Click **Georeference** in the menu near the top of the page. A basemap will open to the right of your chosen image. \n6. Select matching ground control points (GCPs) by clicking on corresponding locations in the image and the basemap. \n> - Zoom in as close as possible to the identified location in order to place the point with greater accuracy. \n> - Each pair of GCPs will be labelled with a matching number.\n> - Move GCPs that have already been placed by clicked on them, holding, and dragging.\n> - View and delete pairs of GCPs by clicking the list icon in the lower right corner.  \n> - Place at least 3-5 pairs of GCPs. More is better. \n> - Try to distribute GCPs somewhat evenly throughout the image.\n7. After a sufficient number of points have been placed, click **Results**. Check to make sure the overlay looks reasonably accurate. You can also check the overlay in more detail by using the opacity sliders in the **Allmaps Viewer** tool. To access this, click the up arrow icon in the lower right corner and click **View in Allmaps Viewer**. If needed, return to the **Georeference** to make further changes. If the results aren't satisfactory, *delete all GCPs* so the scanned map is no longer georeferenced.\n\n## View a Georeferenced Map\n\n- To view a map overlay without leaving the resource page of a georeferenced scanned map, click the **Map Overlay** tab next to the **Item Viewer** tab beneath the title of the page. \n- To open the Allmaps Viewer in a new tab, click **View this georeferenced item** beneath the **Georeferencing** heading in the right sidebar of the resource page. \n- To view all recently georeferenced maps, visit [latest.allmaps.org](https://latest.allmaps.org/).\n- To view a map that you just georeferenced, click the up arrow icon in the lower right corner of the Allmaps Editor interface and click **View in Allmaps Viewer**. \n\n## Edit a Previously Georeferenced Map\n\n1. Open the resource page of a georeferenced scanned map. \n2. Under the **Item Viewer** tab, click three lines (hamburger) icon to expand the sidebar to the left of the map display. \n3. Scroll to the bottom of this sidebar and copy the URL labeled **IIIF manifest**.\n4. Open the Allmaps Editor at [editor.allmaps.org](https://editor.allmaps.org/#/) and paste the IIIF manifest URL into the input box, then click **Load**. Click the **Georeference** tab.\n\n## Other Resources\n\n[Leventhal Map Library's Allmaps Georeferencing Instructions]((https://www.leventhalmap.org/projects/digital-projects/georeferencing/))","src/content/docs/library/allmaps.md","52531b0251e233d6",{"html":605,"metadata":606},"\u003Cp>This document describes the Geoportal’s Allmaps Plugin and gives instructions for using this tool to create a georeferenced map overlay in the browser.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"background\">Background\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#background\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Background”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Georeferencing is the process of using ground control points to match a digital image to the geography of the real world. \u003Ca href=\"https://allmaps.org/\">Allmaps\u003C/a> is an online tool for georeferencing and overlaying any map that follows \u003Ca href=\"https://iiif.io/\">IIIF standards\u003C/a>.

It also gives a background for the BTAA Geospatial Data Project (GDP), and some of the current challenges this project faces that could be remedied by a shared, or common, SDI.\n\n### Existing collaborations across the BTAA for geospatial data\n\nIn 2012, three BTAA map librarians issued a white paper, _A Collaborative Vision for Spatial Scholarship across the CIC_[^1], that described geospatial data as a long term, interdisciplinary need and proposed several collaborative possibilities for managing it.  This paper was a major impetus for the creation of the BTAA Geospatial Data Project (GDP) three years later. The BTAA GDP has accomplished several of the recommendations laid out in the paper, including creating a collective specialized tool for discovering geospatial resources, combining scanned map collections, and encouraging robust communication across the BTAA geospatial community. \n\n\n:::note[BTAA GDP project quick facts]\n* \tNumber of participating institutions: 12\n* \tNumber of project Task Force members: 22\n* \tYear the project began: 2015\n* \tMonth the BTAA Geoportal went online: August 2016\n* \tNumber of resources in the geoportal at launch: 2,300\n* \tNumber of resources as of January 2019: 18,195\n* \tNumber of scanned maps: 6,974\n* \tNumber of geospatial datasets: 10,793\n* \tNumber of geospatial web services: 5,298\n:::\n\n\n\nThe next phase of the BTAA GDP proposes to address another of the paper’s main goals, that of building a “common infrastructure for storing, disseminating, and archiving geospatial data.” (p. 2). A common infrastructure would address two major challenges that BTAA libraries continue to face: managing geospatial data created or licensed at individual libraries and dealing with the ephemeral nature of publicly available open data.\n\n\n### Ongoing challenges across the BTAA for geospatial data\n\n\n#### The challenge of managing licensed geospatial data in libraries\n\nMany of the BTAA map librarians are still storing licensed geospatial data purchased from vendors on physical media or local hard drives, or using a cloud service such as Google Drive or Box. As described in the 2012 white paper[^2],  this leaves the libraries in “reactive mode,” where they must develop piecemeal solutions for delivering geospatial data to patrons. As evidenced by the Summary tab of the [BTAA Spatial Data Infrastructure Details](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10vXL3yyyWBd-V3Qr_42U1RFH_EGod9ZpYg-HP94fw2A/edit?usp=sharing)[^3], there is inconsistency across the BTAA in the institutional infrastructure for this type of geospatial data. Combining our resources and expertise into a shared SDI would fill in the gaps across the chart.\n\n\n#### The challenge of ephemeral open data\n\nAcademic libraries with physical map collections have well-established programs to collect and archive these important information resources for the benefit of their local researcher populations.  Government agencies now issue most geospatial information as digital data instead of as physical maps. However, many academic libraries have not yet expanded their collection scopes to include publicly available digital data, and are therefore no longer systematically capturing the changing geospatial landscape for future researchers. \n\nThe value of this data is high, as researchers routinely use it to form the base layers for web maps or geographic analysis. However, the lack of standard policies at this level of government means that this data can be considered **ephemeral**, as providers regularly migrate, update, delete, and re-publish data without saving previous versions and without notification to the public.[^4]\n\nThe BTAA Geoportal fills a gap in the geospatial data ecosystem by cataloging metadata records for current publicly available state, county, and municipal geospatial data. Because the BTAA Geoportal indexes geospatial data on a monthly basis, we have discovered that the rate at which this ephemeral data disappears is rapid.[^5] This continual turnover creates a difficult environment for researchers to properly source data and replicate results, and it prevents researchers from conducting longitudinal studies that examine change over time for a region. For the geoportal, it requires a great deal of dedicated labor to maintain the correct access links.[^6] As the geoportal’s collection grows, the labor required to maintain it grows as well.\n\nThe barriers that keep libraries from collecting copies of open data, rather than tracking its metadata as the BTAA Geoportal does, include lacking local technology and staff expertise to effectively curate and archive the resources. A shared SDI that utilizes a combination of existing skill sets across the BTAA and new shared technology development would allow libraries to expand their scope to include these types of important research resources.\n\n\n## Introducing a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)\n\nA Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) is defined in a GIS dictionary as “A framework of technologies, policies, standards, and human resources necessary to acquire, process, store, distribute, and improve the use of geospatial data across multiple public and private organizations.”[^7] The benefits of a shared SDI include reduced costs through shared technology, agreed upon standards, and improved data discovery and accessibility. The technology behind a spatial data infrastructure can be broken down into four parts:[^8]\n\n\n\n### 1. Digital Object Preservation and Access\n\n\n\n**About:** The foundation of an SDI is the repository that stores the digital objects. These objects may be reproduced in multiple formats to ensure long term access, and the supporting technology may include preservation services, such as fixity checks and versioning. _non-BTAA example: [Hydra/Samvera at Stanford University](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15420353.2015.1041630)_\n\n**Across the BTAA:** All of the surveyed BTAA institutions host a general data repository that is restricted to content created by university researchers. These repositories are typically used for articles, theses, and supporting data. Although geospatial file formats are accepted to these repositories, they represent a small percentage of the collections.\n\nMost BTAA libraries offer purchased, licensed geospatial data to researchers. Often, this data must be either viewed on site or obtained by contacting a librarian directly. In some cases, university affiliates may be able to access the data from file servers. \n\nFor publicly available state and local data, Indiana University has a dedicated geospatial data repository, and the University of Wisconsin is systematically saving files on hard drives. \n\n\n\n### 2. Geospatial Metadata\n\n\n\n**About**: Geospatial data in an SDI should be fully documented with valid standards-compliant metadata. The metadata can be stored with the actual data files, but is sometimes also stored in a separate catalog. Like other digital archives, authoring metadata is typically the most labor intensive aspect of creating and maintaining an SDI. _BTAA example: GeoNetwork Metadata Catalog using ISO 19139 metadata standard for the BTAA GDP_\n\n**Across the BTAA**: Three BTAA institutions have geospatial metadata experts on staff, who regularly catalog geospatial data (Purdue, Minnesota, Wisconsin) in a geospatial standard (ISO or FGDC). The remaining libraries employ staff who regularly catalog maps using MARC and transfer this knowledge to cataloging datasets as needed.\n\n\n### 3. Geospatial Web Services\n\n\n**About:** Geospatial web services provide an online connection to a dataset hosted on a server. These services allow users to stream and visualize geospatial data in a web browser or mapping application. Users can also load these services through a Desktop GIS without actually downloading the dataset.  Geospatial web services are widely used by researchers to build online maps quickly without needing to rehost data.[^9]\n\nIn order to provide these services, an organization needs to set up a server with a geospatial web service application and load access copies of geospatial datasets into it. _non-BTAA example: [Princeton University’s GeoServer](https://geoserver.princeton.edu/geoserver/web/) (click on Layer Preview, choose OpenLayers option)_\n\n**Across the BTAA**: There are a few instances of locally hosted geospatial web services at BTAA institutions, and they are used for special library projects or initiatives. At most BTAA institutions, campus affiliates can log in to an organizational account for ArcGIS Online to publish their data as ArcGIS REST Services. However, this proprietary platform is generally a temporary host, and users are not always able to port the data to custom applications. Geospatial web services are not currently integrated with any of the BTAA institutional digital repositories or discovery applications.\n\n\n\n### 4. Discovery Applications\n\n**About**: Discovery applications typically take the form of a web portal that allows users to search and filter through a normalized subsection of the full standards metadata. In the case of a geoportal, a graphical interface for searching on a map is also provided. If geospatial web services have been developed, a user can preview and query the dataset to analyze it without the need for specialized software. The BTAA Geoportal is an example of a standalone Discovery Application that relies upon repositories and geospatial web services from external data providers. _non-BTAA example: [GeoData@Tufts built with OpenGeoPortal](https://geodata.tufts.edu/). _\n\n**Across the BTAA**: Indiana University makes their geospatial data available via a custom interface that allows users to select data from nested lists. Two universities (Wisconsin and Purdue) have implemented geoportal applications that also allow users to search by text and via a map interface.\n\nOther universities (Minnesota and Penn State) contribute university created geospatial data to clearinghouses maintained by state agencies. Penn State provides IT assistance and web servers for the statewide clearinghouse.\n\n\n---\n\nSee this spreadsheet for more information: [BTAA Spatial Data Infrastructure Details](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10vXL3yyyWBd-V3Qr_42U1RFH_EGod9ZpYg-HP94fw2A/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n\u003C!-- Footnotes themselves at the bottom. -->\n## Notes\n\n[^1]:\n     Bidney, M., Mattke, R. & Weessies, K.

The goal would be to generate recommendations to hand off to committees (Interface, Collection Development, and Communications).\n\nThe group brainstormed ideas for what analytics to collect and connected those analytics to specific project goals, strategic directions, and needs from specific committees. Once a list was generated, the group met with the project Application Developer and Tableau experts at UMN to determine what was possible and how difficult specific analytics would be to collect and visualize.\n\nFinally, the group created a weighted priority matrix of analytics in order to make final recommendations.\n\n\n## Analytics\n\nThe analytics identified as high priority can be group to answer questions in these categories:\n\n* What is in the collection?\n* What is the geographic coverage of the collection?\n* Where are the users geographically located?\n* By user location, what geographies are of interest?\n* What collection materials are of most interest to users?\n* What collection materials are users downloading?\n\n\n### What is in the collection?\n\nPriority analytics here include being able to create charts showing a filtered output of data records by metadata facets ‒ specifically Genre, Institution, Collection, Time Period, Subject, and Place. The ability to select from multiple categories and multiple values within categories would also be critical.\n\n\n### What is the geographic coverage of the collection?\n\nThis would be achieved by a map showing the bounding boxes of data records in the collection. In addition, being able to filter data records by metadata facets ‒ specifically Genre, Institution, Collection, Time Period, Subject, and Place ‒ would also be critical.\n\n\n### Where are the users geographically located?\n\nPriority analytics here would be the ability to create charts showing the geographical location of users by city or state. If possible, a map output where the geographic region (city or state) indicates the number of users. Additionally, being able to filter data records by metadata facets ‒ specifically Genre, Institution, Collection, Time Period, Subject, and Place ‒ would also be helpful.\n\n\n### By user location, what geographies are of interest?\n\nThis analytics would ideally give project team members the ability to select a geographic place and then see a chart showing the location (city/state) of the users who visited those data record pages.\n\n\n### What collection materials are of most interest to users?\n\nSimilar to the “What is in the collection?” category, but using Page View data rather than the entire collection. Priority analytics here include being able to create charts showing a filtered output of data records by metadata facets ‒ specifically Genre, Institution, Collection, Time Period, Subject, and Place. The ability to select from multiple categories and multiple values within categories would also be critical.\n\n\n### What collection materials are users downloading?\n\nThe ability to see what is being downloaded is the most important analytic here. In addition, the ability to create charts showing a filtered output of data records by metadata facets ‒ specifically Genre, Institution, Collection, Time Period, Subject, and Place. The ability to select from multiple categories and multiple values within categories would also be critical.\n\n\n### What other analytics information should we be collecting?\n\nIn Google Analytics, the project currently collects Event information for Downloads and Spatial Search. The group recommends adding More Details Links, Metadata button, Web Services button, and the Facet “more »” link to the Event data we currently collect.\n\n\n## Priorities\n\nRecognizing that not all of the analytics will be available at first, and in order to give the Application Developer and Tableau Expert a sense of priorities, this is the priority order, as determined by the Weighted Priority Matrix:\n\n\n\n1. Where are the users geographically located?\n2. What collection materials are of most interest to users?\n3. What is in the collection?\n4. What is the geographic coverage of the collection?\n5. What collection materials are users downloading?\n6. By user location, what geographies are of interest?\n\nIn addition, the group recommends adding the analytics Event information listed above.\n\n\n## Connections to Goals & Committees\n\nWhile the analytics may be utilized by any project member or committee, the group identified some specific connections between the analytics categories and existing goals and committees:\n\n* Where are the users geographically located?\n    * Communications Committee\n    * Collection Development Committee\n    * Sustainability Goal\n* What collection materials are of most interest to users?\n    * Communications Committee\n    * Collection Development Committee\n    * Sustainability Goal\n* What is in the collection?\n    * Collection Development Committee\n    * Sustainability Goal\n* What is the geographic coverage of the collection?\n    * Communications Committee\n    * Collection Development Committee\n* What collection materials are users downloading?\n    * Communications Committee\n    * Collection Development Committee\n* By user location, what geographies are of interest?\n    * Communications Committee\n    * Collection Development Committee\n* What other analytics information should we be collecting?\n    * Interface Committee\n    * Metadata Committee\n\n\n## Future Work\n\nIn addition to the analytics mentioned above, the group saw value in collecting some form of analytics around session duration and “bounce rates on home page vs search results page vs item pages.” These fall under the category of “Can users find what they need?” and could be achieved through analytics analysis or by the use of some other tool, such as Crazy Egg (for session duration) or a user survey.\n\nIn the time allotted, the group was not able to determine what would count as “success” for the Geoportal (in terms of analytics) or generate ideas for promotion in order to increase the use of the site ‒ the group recommends that the Steering Committee charge another short-term group or pass this work on to the relevant committee(s).\n\n\n## Documents\n\n[Analytics Weighted Prioritization Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j3XO8MTMGAfq5PwpwsTWoILSQZvrlYRE0C5R4XRTsvk/edit?usp=share_link)\n\n[Meeting Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10AJQcRnAf5ivVsavkzPubh2u3pxLlCecmbR0QCioUXs/edit?usp=share_link)\n\n[Analytics & Goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NJrn35I8Krx2fcA1LNZYdWnal9X8LijaIv3o19ygYsE/edit?usp=share_link)\n\n[Analytics Brainstorming](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IyAL_jJPeHH46j63JjOgqfkdYxpvmFigcgxHIfiqm2k/edit?usp=share_link)","src/content/docs/library/analytics-working-group-report.md","d65c58ef50471b09",{"html":701,"metadata":702},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>November 2018\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#executive-summary\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Executive Summary”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>The Analytics Working Group was initially charged with determining which analytics would be most useful to collect and visualize, examining baseline usage analytics and determining what would count as “success” for the Geoportal (in terms of analytics), as well as generating ideas for promotion in order to increase use of the site.

This document serves as a follow-up to [our initial report](webServicesReport.md) issued in October 2019 and outlines additional details surrounding the deployment of web services for data files stored in institutional repositories across the BTAA Geoportal task force institutions. For this work we focused on geospatial data (not scanned maps) and used the Esri ArcGIS platform for our testing environment.\n\n#### Centralized vs. Distributed Models\n\nIn our initial report, we characterized the distinction between centralized and distributed models for authoring web services. A centralized model would involve sharing data to a central repository where project staff would manage the data and create web services. A distributed model would mean selected university-affiliated dataset(s) would be stored at the home institution (or in a third-party, disciplinary repository) and the web services would be authored by task force members.  \n\n##### Distributed Model & Testing Environment \n\nOur test environment for creating web services, documenting example workflows, and providing recommendations is based on a distributed model. In our model testing environment it is assumed individual task force institutions would utilize the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal Project’s ESRI ArcGIS organizational account to publish services. While it is likely that many participating institutions have their own ESRI ArcGIS Organizational Accounts, we feel that for the longevity of the web services work would be most successful if a common platform is used.\n\n##### Centralized Model\n\nWhile not a focus of this pilot project, it is important to note that setting up a centralized environment for hosting data and creating web services could be possible \\- and could benefit task force institutions (both current and future members). An open source solution such as GeoServer (and an associated relational database to manage content) would eliminate reliance on ESRI ArcGIS for this work.\n\n## Details of the pilot\n\nFor this pilot, we focused on University research geospatial data for several reasons: \n\n1. To highlight data that was housed at member institutions, rather than ‘public data’ created by state or local governments already published elsewhere;   \n2. To focus on content that likely does not already have associated web services;   \n3. To strategize about how to advertise web services as a way to get data out to a wide audience when communicating with campus researchers.\n\nDifferent data sources come with unique challenges. For research data, there is significant heterogeneity in data formats and subject matter between datasets in the same repository, limiting the possibility of automated workflows. Academic researchers are more likely to want an active role in the representation of project data. This increases the amount of time required per dataset to generate web services, as much of this time would involve appropriately communicating with researchers early in the data selection process.  \n\nFor public data, additional challenges may occur in dealing with datasets that are being frequently updated over time or originally hosted as a web service by another organization.  Exploring these challenges was out of scope for our pilot.\n\nFor this pilot, we also only looked at the workflows for hosted feature layers. For a more detailed explanation of hosted feature layers and other layer types, see the associated [ArcGIS Online documentation](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/hosted-web-layers.htm).\n\n**Testing Environment**\n\nThe BTAA Geoportal has a dedicated ESRI ArcGIS organizational account ([http://geobtaa.maps.arcgis.com/](http://geobtaa.maps.arcgis.com/)). The account provides:\n\n- cloud storage for data and web services in ArcGIS Online  \n- the ability to make data available publicly through an ArcGIS Hub site  \n- access to ArcGIS products for task force members if they do not have it through their home institution \n\nLogins are available to any member of the BTAA Geoportal task force. \n\nOther options for hosting geospatial web services (i.e. Geoserver) require substantial set-up and IT support. For the purpose of this pilot and for short-term web service needs of the geoportal, ArcGIS was selected as the most viable option. \n\nThe overarching steps outlined below describe platform-agnostic actions needed to create geospatial web services, while the subpoints provide specific considerations for hosting research data in ArcGIS Online.\n\n## Example Workflow(s)\n\n### Step 1: Identify if the data layer would be a good candidate for a web service\n\n* Is it archived in a repository or institutionally managed long-term storage space with downloadable data?   \n  * Is it a small enough file size to display quickly and well?  \n  * Has it been assigned a creative commons license (or similar) that allows for redistribution?  \n  * Would it be of interest to a broad audience such that it is worth the time and resources necessary to create a web service?  \n  * Does the researcher need to make the data available as part of grant or publication requirements?\n\n### Step 2: Communicate with the researcher / data creator(s) (when appropriate)\n\n* Ensure that a web service does not already exist for the resource  \n  * Ask about preferred symbolization \n\n### Step 3: Choose the best format for the web service layer\n\n* Hosted feature layer   \n  * Users can fully interact with data including changing symbology and filtering values  \n  * Map service   \n    * Tiling capabilities allow for quick rendering of larger datasets and images  \n  * Time-enabled layer  \n    * Web service can be used to display change over time\n\n### Step 4: Assess format and completeness of metadata\n\n\t  \nThe main documentation for the data should be available from the institutional repository/storage space and the main discovery metadata will be the Geoblacklight record in the BTAA geoportal.  That said, there is no method for creating publicly visible web services in ArcGIS Online without also making them searchable through the ArcGIS platform. To remain a trustworthy entity for providing geospatial data, some metadata must be uploaded with the data or manually created for the web service. \n\nThe flowchart below suggests how to proceed in order to most efficiently create minimal metadata for the web service: \n\n![ArcGIS Online flowchart](@images/arcGISFlowchart.png)\n\n\nWhen manually adding metadata, we recommend including a (non-hyperlinked) URL to the more complete documentation for the hosted data or to the geoblacklight item page in the “Description” element. For additional best practices, see [Item Description in ArcGIS Hub](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/geospatial-metadata/best-practice-guides/item-description-in-arcgis-hub).\n\n### Step 5: Choose an upload method based on functionality needed in the resulting web service\n\n#### Option1: Adding zip files to ArcGIS Online from the content pane\n\n   *Recommended for most items*  \n     \n   One way to create a web service is by compressing a geospatial data file (.zip) and uploading it directly to ArcGIS Online. While straightforward, this process limits any cartographic styling that might be necessary to represent the data in an appropriate way. When a zip file is uploaded, ArcGIS Online requires entries for the service title, ISO topic category, and associated tags. There is no official controlled vocabulary for the “tag” entries. Best practices may suggest the use of existing controlled keywords or subject headings in the tags field. If metadata exists already, a file can be included, however, the only acceptable form is an.xml file in the ArcGIS Format schema.     \n   \n\n#### Option 2: Publishing a web service from data in ArcGIS Desktop\n\n   *Best choice for items with complicated cartographic styling*  \n     \n   Another way to create a web service in ArcGIS Online is to add the data to ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro and publish from there. The advantage of this approach is that the new web service inherits the cartographic styling of the original data source. The disadvantage is that the workflow to add appropriate metadata is more complicated. Through testing a number of different workflows in both ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro, we discovered that only one resulted in full metadata functionality (in line with what is achieved by directly uploading data to ArcGIS Online). The steps used in this workflow were:   \n1. add original data to ArcMap  \n2. use the Export Metadata tool to create a new .xml file   \n3. publish the hosted feature layer  \n4. import the new .xml file into ArcGIS Online’s metadata web editor using the Overwrite function (Note: The organization must have “Metadata enabled” for this online metadata editor to be available).\n\n   This could be an appropriate alternate workflow in cases where the cartographic styling of the original data is particularly important to its interpretation, sharing, and reuse, but is certainly more time intensive than adding zip files directly to ArcGIS Online. Further investigation would be necessary to determine if a comparable workflow exists in ArcGIS Pro, as one was not identified through this preliminary investigation.\n\n### Step 6: Create Geoblacklight metadata or link to the web service from an existing geoportal record.\n\nShare the web service publicly and then copy the URL from the bottom of the page.  \n\n![](@images/arcGISServicesUrl.png)\n\n1. If the web service will be associated with a new record in the geoportal: \n\nComplete the elements requested in Web Servies tab of [this CSV template](https://z.umn.edu/b1g-template).\n\n2. If a record already exists for the data layer in the geoportal: \n\n   Request a CSV spreadsheet of Geoblacklight metadata for geospatial data items contributed by your institution. Find the relevant item and add the copied web service URL into the “FeatureServer” column.\n\n   \n\n## Key Considerations \n\n#### Scope\n\nOur pilot focused on web services created by BTAA partner institutions/task force members for their university-affiliated research data.  More automated workflows would need to be considered in order to implement web services for public data or for additional academic institutions outside the BTAA Geoportal task force.\n\n#### Time\n\nSince not all task force members routinely work with the ArcGIS platform, time would need to be spent building capacity around workflows. Responsibility and demands on time for task force members and project staff will have an impact on the ability to successfully create web services. This may vary from one institution to the next.\n\n#### Metadata\n\nIn many cases, the metadata that describes a web service must be completed separately from the metadata that accompanies the data file(s). Taskforce members will need to generate descriptive metadata for the Esri platform as well as complete Geoblacklight metadata for use in the BTAA geoportal.  We explored the possibility of creating an ArcGIS Hub Site to leverage our existing automated processes. This would create an additional access point to the data  however \\- increasing the complexity of the metadata that should be included in ArcGIS Online and all of the associated workflows. For research data (lower volume and more heterogeneous projects), we recommend manually creating the Geoblacklight metadata. \n\n#### Data rights/access constraints\n\nIf the data is stored in an institutional (or third-party, disciplinary) repository, it is important to understand any usage or access restrictions placed on the content either by the data producer or the institution.  This information should be displayed within the Geoportal whenever possible.\n\n#### Cartography\n\nUnderstanding how best to represent a specific dataset cartographically can be a challenge. Characteristics like temporal coverage can complicate this even further.\n\n#### Communication with researchers\n\nTo author web services in the most responsible way, it may be necessary to communicate directly with the researcher who created the data. The researcher may be the best resource for providing information on how best to display the data cartographically, or if there are special considerations for particular dataset(s).\n\n#### Data size/format limitations\n\nUnderstanding the limitations of the ArcGIS platform can help determine whether a service can be generated or not. If a dataset is too large, it will fail. There may be a need for further guidance for task force members in situations where the dataset they are working with includes more than one layer (e.g., a map package or geodatabase).\n\n#### Technology\n\nSome workflows for creating web services require knowledge of software like ArcMap and an understanding of the structure of the data files. This may be a barrier to task force members wanting to move forward with web services. Training will likely be required and more detailed instructions created.\n\n#### Additional opportunities\n\nIt could be possible to target web service creation as part of the research data management process. If researchers understand the possibilities of web services earlier in their process,  it might offer a new way of sharing their data beyond simple raw data downloads. While valuable, raw data downloads may lack a certain level of context within the larger research project. The ability to publish a cartographic visualization might enhance a user’s understanding of individual data elements as they relate to the research project as a whole.\n\n## Conclusion / Recommendation\n\nBased on our pilot, ArcGIS Online could be a feasible option for taskforce members interested in hosting web services for select research data. Due to challenges with the scalability of publishing workflows and the heterogeneous nature of research data, this method would likely not work for harvesting large batches of data from an institutional partner or possible external universities.","src/content/docs/library/arcgis-online-pilot.md",[761,762],"@images/arcGISFlowchart.png","@images/arcGISServicesUrl.png","62ef1e4122b50483",{"html":765,"metadata":766},"\u003Cp>May 2020\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#introduction\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Introduction”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>The ArcGIS Enterprise Organization Working Group (a.k.a the Web Services Working Group) has continued to explore the implementation of web services technology for geospatial datasets within the BTAA Geoportal.

In recent years, ArcGIS Hub / Open Data Portals have emerged as the most popular publishing application for geospatial data providers. While this platform excels with user experience and data accessibility, it enables problematic publishing practices that contribute to link rot.  Additionally, when migrating a dataset between the ArcGIS suite of products, it is very easy for the metadata to get lost.\n\nThis guide presents publishing workflows that improve the stability of data identifiers and maximize benefits from metadata of resources on ArcGIS Hub / Open Data Portals.\n\nStable data identifiers prevent URL links from breaking for those who are using your data dynamically in web maps or for sites that aggregate resources.  They also reduce time required to maintain and update links within your own organizational website, protecting investment of time and labor in the resources you have created.\n\nStrong metadata workflows ensure that the context needed to trust and understand data stays associated with the resource.  When information about data collection steps are not written down or become separated from the data, data users are likely to be frustrated and more likely to use data incorrectly.  Losing track of metadata creates more work down the road for staff trying to answer questions from the public or others in the office about unfamiliar data. Metadata is also critical for making resources more discoverable within the open data environment.  Providing descriptive text about your data will make these resources much more likely to show up in searches within ArcGIS Online and Google.\n\nAt the time of writing this guide, the best option for keeping metadata associated with data in ArcHub is to create metadata using ArcCatalog and then to upload individual shapefiles to ArcGIS Online through the Content Pane.  With this workflow, information specific to each data layer can be displayed on item pages and metadata is included with shapefile downloads.\n\nIf your organization must publish data from a desktop platform (i.e. ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro), it is only possible to provide item description metadata for the entire service, not for individual layers.  Metadata cannot be automatically included with data downloaded from ArcGIS Hub.  A workaround is to “enable metadata for your organization” and then use the online metadata editor to make a separate metadata file available from the download dropdown in ArcGIS Hub.  This workaround also can be used in conjunction with other publishing workflows to provide additional metadata in alternative formats, such as a PDF or spreadsheet with attribute field definitions. \n\nIf you do “enable metadata for your organization,” it will affect how metadata is displayed to users online when they “View Metadata.”  It will also affect the format of metadata in cases where it is available with shapefile downloads. Metadata created or changed online (on the item page or in the online metadata editor) will not be included in data downloaded from ArcGIS Hub.\n\nExamining every combination of settings was beyond the scope of this guide and best practice changes frequently with updates to ArcGIS products and tools.  We recommend checking that your organization’s specific publishing workflow: \n\n* preserves data identifiers\n* provides layer specific metadata on your open data site \n* makes documentation available for download, optimally in a format bundled with the data itself \n\n------------------------------------------\n\n## Checklist \n\nTo improve the stability and usefulness of resources on ArcGIS Hub:\n\n- [x] Enable persistent layer ordering. Existing links will not break if the layers in a map service are reordered or if new data is added or removed from the service.\n- [x] When possible and appropriate, **overwrite existing services** to update layers. Item IDs will remain the same, preserving links and other layer properties (e.g. item page information, symbology, and pop-up configurations)\n- [x] Edit metadata on the desktop** (i.e. ArcCatalog), rather than using the online metadata editor or making changes on item pages. Metadata generated offline can be bundled with shapefile downloads. Revisions made to metadata online will not be reflected in these downloaded files.\n- [x] Publish zipped shapefiles or single feature layer geodatabases by uploading directly into ArcGIS Online through the Content Pane. This is the only method for publishing data that supports layer level metadata in your open data portal and allows metadata to be automatically included with shapefile downloads. \n- [x] If you have to publish services from a desktop platform, consider **enabling metadata for your organization**. While metadata will not be automatically included with shapefile download, this setting makes it possible to manually add service-level metadata for download as a spreadsheet, PDF or other format.\n- [x] Double check that your organization’s specific publishing workflow preserves data identifiers and makes sufficient metadata available for download. It is beyond the scope of this guide to discuss every possible publishing workflow and the software frequently changes.  \n\n--------------------------------\n\n\n## Section 1: Publishing practices for stable identifiers\n\nEvery item (unit of content) published to ArcGIS Online is assigned a unique identifier.   Depending on your publishing workflow, however, you may unintentionally generate new identifiers for data even though the content has not changed substantially. \n\nThings that may cause this behavior include:\n\n* stopping and restarting a server\n* deleting and republishing a dataset to update it\n\n\n### 1.1  Overwriting existing files\n\nOverwriting existing files is one way to avoid frequent changes to identifiers and broken links for your data users.  \n\nWhen should you overwrite/update: \n\n* if you are making a small revision to a dataset or correcting an error\n* if the data is frequently updated or programmed to sync with local servers at regular intervals\n\nWhen should you republish:\n\n* if it is a “new” dataset - something that has been changed substantially so that it no longer matches the description provided in the metadata\n\n**Workflows for overwriting resources:**\n\n**ArcMap 10.4.1:**\n\nFile →  Share As → Service → Overwrite Existing Service\n\n**ArcGIS Online:**\n\nOn the right side of a hosted feature layer item page: \n\nClick on Update Data, then chose “Update Entire Laye**r**”\n\nNote that all field names and layers in the file you upload must be the same as the original file\n\n\n### 1.2  Enable persistent layer ordering\n\n([from ESRI help documentation on server configuration details](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/hub/data/server-configuration-details.htm))\n\nWhen adding a layer to ArcGIS Online to be used in Hub, a URL to the service will have a number on it so the request goes to the right layer. It can be problematic in older versions of ArcGIS Server when changes are made to the services that affect the order of these numbers. In ArcGIS Server 10.3, on the map service's MXD data frame properties, you can enable persistent layer IDs. This means that if the layers are reordered or new data is added or removed from the service, the existing links will not break.\n\n![alt_text](@images/open-data_image1.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\n--------------------------------------\n## Section 2: Providing quality metadata\n\nMetadata (the documentation and context necessary to make sense of data) is especially important in the open data environment. \n\n* **Metadata improves the discoverability of your data resources.** Providing descriptive text about your data will make these resources much more likely to show up in searches within ArcGIS Online and Google.  ArcGIS Online uses the title, tags, description, terms of use / use constraints, and summary in its search algorithms.\n* **Metadata makes data more usable and trustworthy.** Without contextual information about who created the data, what processes were used to collect and prepare data, and what cryptic attribute field names mean - data may be rendered useless.  \n\nDespite its importance, it is very easy for metadata to be separated from data as it is published to and downloaded from ArcGIS Hub/Open Data Portals.  Transfer of information between desktop and online products is problematic, as is transformation between different metadata styles.  Publishing services from desktop platforms limits the granularity of metadata and organization-level settings have some unintuitive impacts on how metadata displays and downloads.\n\nWhat steps can you take to protect the time and effort you have invested into describing your data? To reduce having to manually add metadata in multiple places?  To have the documentation stay connected to the data resource as it moves within the digital environment?\n\nSection 2.1 of this guide discusses how different methods for publishing data and organizational settings affect metadata display and download in Hub /Open Data Portals.  Section 2.2 recommends what to include when writing quality metadata.    \n\n\n### 2.1 Publishing metadata\n\nThere are a large number of settings that impact how metadata is displayed and available from Hub / Open Data Portals. This includes:\n\n* the method used to publish data (e.g. adding item to ArcGIS Online from the content pane, publishing services from ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro, or using a programmatic tool such as ArcGIS API for Python)\n* what tool is used to create metadata and whether it is generated before or after being published (ArcCatalog, ArcGIS Online metadata editor, editing the item details page)\n* whether ArcGIS Online organizational account has “metadata enabled”\n* what style metadata was set for the organizational account when data is uploaded and what style is currently selected\n* the version of server and desktop software\n\nMetadata may be available in multiple locations and formats within an open data portal - most notably as text on the item page, by clicking the “view metadata” link, and as an .xml file accompanying shapefile downloads.\n\n\n![alt_text](@images/open-data_image2.jpg \"image_tooltip\")\n\n\nThe section below offers some general advice about how publishing workflows and other settings affect metadata for your resources.  \n\n[Please see the Metadata Workflow Options for Open Data Portals chart for a more comprehensive look](#metadata-workflow-options-for-open-data-portals) \n\nExamining every combination of settings was beyond the scope of this report and best practice changes frequently with updates to ArcGIS products and tools.  Overarching goals for making useful metadata should be to:\n\n* Provide layer specific, human-readable metadata on your site \n* Make documentation available for download, optimally in a format bundled with the data itself \n\n\n#### 2.1.1 Enabling metadata for your organization\n\nSite administrators have the option to “enable metadata for your organization” within the item settings for their enterprise account.  This terminology is confusing since the setting doesn’t affect what types of metadata can be uploaded, just how it will be formatted in online display and downloads.  Currently, organizations can only choose one metadata style (e.g. FGDC, ISO 19139) of formatting which will be applied to all of their records. \n\n\n![alt_text](@images/open-data_image3.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\n\nTurning on this setting:\n\n* **formats the “view metadata” page based on the metadata style selected for your organization** -  All items uploaded to your organization will have this formatting regardless of whether you have provided metadata in this style.  If you turn off this setting later, the “view metadata” page will continue to be formatted in the style that was last enabled. \n* **formats the metadata file downloaded with shapefiles based on the metadata style selected for your organization**  -  The metadata setting you have in place when you upload data will determine what format it will take when downloaded with shapefiles.  For example, if you have metadata enabled for your organization with FGDC style selected, upload layers, and then turn off the setting, the downloaded shapefiles for these layers will still have FGDC formatting.  The .xml files cannot be edited in ArcCatalog without transforming back into the ArcGIS 1.0 metadata standard.  \n* **provides access to an online metadata editor** - Changes that are made using the editor will only modify online descriptions of your data and will not be incorporated into metadata downloads from your open data portal. Because of this, we recommend editing metadata with desktop software. If you do edit metadata using this tool (or on the item page while metadata is enabled), you can “Save Local Copy**”** to get an XML file with revisions made online. Use this file to update the offline copy of the data and then overwrite the layer in your open data portal.\n\nEnabling metadata could be a good option if:   \n\n* You have to publish data using a desktop platform and need to use the online editor to provide some metadata for download (such as a PDF or spreadsheet with attribute field definitions)\n\n\n#### 2.1.2 Publishing Workflows\n\n** RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW: Uploading directly to ArcGIS Online via the Content Pane **\n\nUploading directly to ArcGIS Online via the content pane offers the opportunity to provide individual-layer level metadata.  (Note that, unlike files loaded into web maps, these [hosted feature layers do not have feature limits](https://support.esri.com/en/technical-article/000012039).)\n\nWhen shapefiles or single feature layer geodatabases are uploaded to the content pane, the item page will automatically be populated from existing metadata.  \n\nThe “view metadata” link on the open data site also draws on this content.  If metadata is enabled, the page will be loosely based around the organization’s selected metadata standard (e.g. FGDC, ISO 19139, etc).  If metadata is not enabled and no metadata created for the layer prior to upload, the “view metadata” button will link back to the ArcGIS Online page for the resource - even if metadata has been filled in later.\n\nPerhaps the greatest advantage to uploading resources directly to the content pane is that it is possible to have metadata accompany shapefile downloads.  The data must have a metadata file when it is originally uploaded to ArcGIS Online or it won’t have one when the file is downloaded - even if you fill out information on the item page or add information to the online metadata editor. Also revisions that you make to metadata online will not be reflected in metadata downloaded from the open data portal.\n\nIf metadata is enabled (see section 2.1.1), the shapefile download will include an .xml file in the metadata standard specified by your organization at the time of upload.  It will not be possible to open these files in ArcCatalog without transforming them back into ArcGIS 1.0 metadata.  If metadata is not enabled at the time the data is uploaded, the shapefile download will include an .xml file in ArcGIS 1.0 metadata.  ArcCatalog will see this file as being separate from the rest of the shapefile, but it is possible to open and edit without transformation.\n\n**Publishing services from a desktop platform:**\n\nMetadata for services can be created through the “Map Document Properties” (before publishing your service) or the Item Description tab of the Service Editor (during the publishing process).\n\n \n![alt_text](@images/open-data_image4.png \"image_tooltip\")\n                   \n![alt_text](@images/open-data_image5.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\n\nWhen shared to an open data portal, each layer that is published as part of a service will have its own page.  The metadata for these pages, however, will all be the same, matching the information available for the overarching service. It is not possible to customize the metadata (description, tags, and use constraints) for individual layers.  Metadata that has been created for individual layers within ArcCatalog will not appear anywhere online.\n\nMetadata files are also not automatically included with any of the download format options.\n\nWhen to publish from the desktop:\n\n* if layers are closely related such that it makes sense to describe them as a set rather than individually.\n* If you plan to use the online metadata editor to manually add additional metadata distribution options (see below). \n\n**ALTERNATE WORKFLOW / WORKAROUND: Adding metadata files to the download dropdown**\n\n\n![alt_text](@images/open-data_image6.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\n\nYou can include additional download file formats or related documents by adding links in the Distribution section of ArcGIS 1.0 Format Metadata. These files will then show up in the download dropdown in ArcGIS Hub.  While preference should be given to workflows that include metadata directly with the data download (so that users have the information even if they don’t realize that they will need it later), this could be an option if you need to publish services from a desktop platform or want to provide an alternative metadata format, such as a PDF or spreadsheet with attribute field definitions\n\n(Steps modified [from ESRI help documentation on preparing your data](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/hub/data/prepare-your-data.htm) )\n\nArcGIS Online \n\nYou must “enable metadata for your organization” (see section 2.1.1)\n\n1. From the item page, click Metadata. \n2. Within the metadata form, choose Distribution. \n3. In the Online Resource page that appears, click the + sign.\n4. Enter a URL to your download file, or external related link. This could be a non-hosted file that you have uploaded to ArcGIS Online through the Content Pane or a link to an organizational website / ftp server.\n5. Enter a name for the file. This name will appear on ArcGIS Hub.\n6. Change the Function to Download.\n\n ArcCatalog: \n\n1. Click on an item in the directory.  Select the “description” tab and click to “Edit” the metadata. \n2. Select “Distribution” under the Resource section.\n3. Click on the + sign by “New Digital Transfer Options”\n4. Click on the  + sign. By “New Online Resource”\n5. Follow steps 4 through 6 above. \n\n\n### 2.2 Tips for creating quality metadata for ArcGIS Online\n\nArcGIS Online has limited capability handling standards-based metadata at this time.  Providing quality item description metadata should therefore be a priority for resources hosted on ArcGIS open data portals.  In particular, choosing a meaningful title and writing a thorough description will help users understand the value and limitations of your data. \n\nIn ArcGIS Hub/ Open Data Portals the only metadata elements visible on the main page are: title, description, tags, and access/use constraints.\n\n**Title:**  Theme, Where, When  (e.g. City Zoning, Minneapolis, 2015)\n\n**Tags / Keywords:**  Tags are used to make data more discoverable. Think about what words someone might use when searching for your layers. Avoid being too broad (e.g. “GIS”, “open data”), too narrow (e.g. project acronyms), and typos. If you are not sure what to choose, picking terms from a “dictionary” of disciplinary subjects can be a good place to start (e.g. [ISO 19115 Topic Categories](https://www2.usgs.gov/science/about/thesaurus-full.php?thcode=15))\n\n**Description:** \n\n* Description of content of the layer or the list of layers included in the service (could also include most important or unique attributes)\n* Purpose (why has this data been collected or the reason it is being made available)\n* Lineage (where the data came from and any changes that were made)\n* Temporal extent of data collection / time period that data represents\n* Special data characteristics or use limitations (e.g. excluded geographies, scale digitized)\n\n**Access and Use Constraints (when publishing a Map Document service)) / Use Limitation (ArcCatalog) / Terms of Use (on item page)**: Adding a license for your data helps data users know how they can work with the data and when to give credit.  You can add custom text specific to your organization or a standardized open data license..   \n\n“If you add a Creative Commons license (CC0, CC BY, CC BY-SA) by either the name or URL, the dataset page will display the Creative Commons license icon and will link to the appropriate license details web page. If you add an Open Data Commons license (PDDL, ODbL, ODC-By) the dataset page will display the license name and link to the appropriate license details web page.” ([from ESRI help documentation on preparing your data](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/hub/data/prepare-your-data.htm) ) \n\n**Elements that are part of the item description, but are not visible on ArcGIS Open Data Portal item pages:**\n\n**Summary:** Very brief description (1 sentence) about what the data is and (if applicable) how it relates to other maps or applications from the organization.  Despite the fact that “Summary” is included in dialog boxes whenever saving changes to a resource in ArcGIS Online, this text does not appear on open data portals.\n\n**Credits:** If the data you are publishing were created by a specific individual or derived from an outside source, cite this source.  This metadata element is hidden on the open data portals, so you may want to also provide this information as part of the description.\n\n\n## Resources for working with metadata in ArcGIS Online:\n\n[Manage data (with frequently asked questions about metadata)](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/metadata.htm)\n\n[Publish hosted feature layers ](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/publish-features.htm)(Content Pane, Arc Pro, ArcMap)\n\n## Metadata Workflow Options for Open Data Portals\n\n\u003Cp>\n\u003Cstrong>Publishing a service (from ArcMap 10.4.1)\u003C/strong>\n\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Ctable>\n  \u003Ctr>\n   \u003Ctd>\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>ArcGIS Hub item page\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>View Metadata\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>Shapefile downloads\n   \u003C/td>\n  \u003C/tr>\n  \u003Ctr>\n   \u003Ctd>Shapefiles or file geodatabases\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd> Information from the “Map Document Properties” (before publishing your service) or the Item Description tab of the Service Editor (during the publishing process)\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>Opens item details page for service\n\u003Cp>\nIf metadata is enabled….If you open the metadata editor for the service and save, it will open an html with item description metadata\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>No\n   \u003C/td>\n  \u003C/tr>\n\u003C/table>\n\n\n\u003Cp>\n\u003Cstrong>Direct upload of layer to ArcGIS Content Pane\u003C/strong>\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n\u003Cstrong>File Geodatabases\u003C/strong>\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\nMetadata Enabled: Direct upload of layer to ArcGIS Content Pane\n\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Ctable>\n  \u003Ctr>\n   \u003Ctd> \n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd colspan=\"4\" >ArcGIS Online\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd colspan=\"3\" >ArcGIS Hub\n   \u003C/td>\n  \u003C/tr>\n  \u003Ctr>\n   \u003Ctd>\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd colspan=\"2\" >Hosted Feature Layer\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd colspan=\"2\" >\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd colspan=\"3\" >\n   \u003C/td>\n  \u003C/tr>\n  \u003Ctr>\n   \u003Ctd>\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>On item page\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>“View metadata”\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>Included with \n\u003Cp>\nshapefile\n\u003Cp>\ndownload \n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>Included with file geodatabase download\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>On item page\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>“View metadata” \n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>Included with shapefile download \n   \u003C/td>\n  \u003C/tr>\n  \u003Ctr>\n   \u003Ctd>Multiple files:\n\u003Cp>\nStandards-based metadata added in ArcCatalog before upload\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>No -

In recent years, ArcGIS Hub / Open Data Portals have emerged as the most popular publishing application for geospatial data providers. While this platform excels with user experience and data accessibility, it enables problematic publishing practices that contribute to link rot.  Additionally, when migrating a dataset between the ArcGIS suite of products, it is very easy for the metadata to get lost.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This guide presents publishing workflows that improve the stability of data identifiers and maximize benefits from metadata of resources on ArcGIS Hub / Open Data Portals.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stable data identifiers prevent URL links from breaking for those who are using your data dynamically in web maps or for sites that aggregate resources.  They also reduce time required to maintain and update links within your own organizational website, protecting investment of time and labor in the resources you have created.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Strong metadata workflows ensure that the context needed to trust and understand data stays associated with the resource.  When information about data collection steps are not written down or become separated from the data, data users are likely to be frustrated and more likely to use data incorrectly.  Losing track of metadata creates more work down the road for staff trying to answer questions from the public or others in the office about unfamiliar data. Metadata is also critical for making resources more discoverable within the open data environment.  Providing descriptive text about your data will make these resources much more likely to show up in searches within ArcGIS Online and Google.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At the time of writing this guide, the best option for keeping metadata associated with data in ArcHub is to create metadata using ArcCatalog and then to upload individual shapefiles to ArcGIS Online through the Content Pane.  With this workflow, information specific to each data layer can be displayed on item pages and metadata is included with shapefile downloads.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If your organization must publish data from a desktop platform (i.e. ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro), it is only possible to provide item description metadata for the entire service, not for individual layers.  Metadata cannot be automatically included with data downloaded from ArcGIS Hub.  A workaround is to “enable metadata for your organization” and then use the online metadata editor to make a separate metadata file available from the download dropdown in ArcGIS Hub.  This workaround also can be used in conjunction with other publishing workflows to provide additional metadata in alternative formats, such as a PDF or spreadsheet with attribute field definitions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you do “enable metadata for your organization,” it will affect how metadata is displayed to users online when they “View Metadata.”  It will also affect the format of metadata in cases where it is available with shapefile downloads. Metadata created or changed online (on the item page or in the online metadata editor) will not be included in data downloaded from ArcGIS Hub.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Examining every combination of settings was beyond the scope of this guide and best practice changes frequently with updates to ArcGIS products and tools.

The project will launch and populate a geoportal instance for CIC institutions and will support the creation and guide the aggregation of discovery-focused metadata describing geospatial data resources relevant to researchers at participating institutions. The project will also provide the technology project staffing and infrastructure to host the services.\n \n\n## Administrative Info\n\n### Project Name: CIC Geospatial Data Discovery Project\n\nProject Sponsors: For the CIC Directors: Wendy Lougee (Minnesota), Cliff Haka (Michigan State), James Hilton (Michigan) and CIC CLI Director Mark Sandler; for operations at the University of Minnesota: John Butler and Claire Stewart\n\nProject Manager: Kevin Dyke\n\nCharter Prepared by: Ryan Mattke\n\nDate Prepared: July 1, 2015\n\nDate Edited: May 4, 2016\n\n\n### Primary Resource Providers: \n\n* Kirsten Clark, Director, Access & Information Services, University of Minnesota \n* Len Kne, Associate Director, U-Spatial, University of Minnesota\n* Ryan Mattke, Head, John R. Borchert Map Library, University of Minnesota\n* Managers of the members of the CIC Geospatial Task Force.\n\n\n### Consulted for Charter Development:\n\n* Mara Blake, Spatial & Numeric Data Librarian, University of Michigan \n* John Butler, Associate University Librarian for Data & Technology, University of Minnesota\n* Kirsten Clark, Director, Access & Information Services, University of Minnesota \n* Kevin Dyke, Spatial Data Analyst/Curator, University of Minnesota \n* Len Kne, Associate Director, U-Spatial, University of Minnesota\n* Mark Sandler, Director, CIC Center for Library Initiatives\n* Claire Stewart, Associate University Librarian for Research & Learning, University of Minnesota\n* Kathleen Weessies, Head, Map Library, Michigan State University \n\n\n## Project Background & Updates\n\n### Background\n\nScholars across academia increasingly demand access to geospatial data to facilitate their research. The 2012 CIC CLI conference ([Finding Our Way: Collaborative Strategies for Developing Geospatial Services](http://www.cic.net/calendar/conferences/library/2012/home)) focused on this demand. A group of CIC geospatial librarians has been working on how to best provide our users access to geospatial data.\n\nIncluding the University of Minnesota, nine CIC institutions have expressed interest in this project. By collaborating, we can more effectively combine our efforts and expertise for the benefit of the consortium. Participant institutions include: the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Iowa, the University of Maryland, the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, the University of Minnesota, Pennsylvania State University, Purdue University, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\n### Communication Plan\n\nA formal communication plan will be finalized at the two-day conference in Fall 2015. This will likely include monthly or bi-monthly remote meetings of the entire CIC Geospatial Task Force, monthly or bi-weekly remote meetings of the Steering Group, and regular email check-ins for the Task Force. Remote meetings will be conducted via WebEx.\n\nProject work will be tracked on Asana with monthly progress summaries. Ongoing work will be visible to anyone via a public Google Site containing project documents, progress summaries, etc.\n\nAn Executive Committee, comprising the library directors at the University of Minnesota, University of Michigan, and Michigan State, as well as Mark Sandler (or designee) representing the CIC CLI, will serve as the primary sponsors of the project and the link between the project and the directors/CIC CLI leadership. The Steering Committee will provide written updates to be shared with the Directors at their bi-annual meetings, and additional updates as requested.\n\nOnce the project has achieved significant milestones, the Steering Committee will consider how best to report on the project accomplishments, via conference presentations, poster sessions, etc.\n\n \n\n## Scope & Expectations\n\n### Scope (Year 1 & Year 2)\n\n* Staffing considerations\n    * Hire a CIC Geospatial Project Metadata Coordinator\n    * Utilize 0.25 FTE of the University of Minnesota Libraries’ Spatial Data Analyst/Curator as a project manager\n* CIC Geospatial Task Force\n    * Establish a CIC Geospatial Data Task Force including representatives from each institution\n    * Establish a Steering Group for the purpose of efficient decision making\n    * Evaluate existing and emerging open source geoportal software options and determine most appropriate application for project execution\n        * Specifically, will review Open Geoportal (originally planned application) and. GeoBlacklight (emerging since time of original proposal)\n* Metadata creation & coordination\n    * Create geospatial metadata records for ingest into the geospatial data portal\n    * Determine the most appropriate data sets for geospatial metadata creation\n    * Identify unique CIC resources for possible inclusion in specialized geoportal instances\n* Geoportal creation\n    * Create and host a production-level geospatial data portal that will act as the primary access point for CIC geospatial data resources\n\n### Out of Scope\n\n* Asset data storage\n* Data curation and management\n* Extensive interface customization (Year 1 & Year 2)\n* Access to licensed data requiring authentication (Year 1 & Year 2)\n\n## Resources: Project Staffing, Timeline, Costs\n\n### Roles and Effort\n\nA small team of project staff at the University of Minnesota will manage the day-to-day work of the project:\n\n* Ryan Mattke, project owner, 10% FTE\n* Kevin Dyke, University of Minnesota, project manager, 25% FTE\n* TBD, University of Minnesota, metadata coordinator, 100% FTE\n* Graduate Research Assistants, University of Minnesota, variable FTE\n\nFor individuals from participating institutions, please see the CIC Geospatial Data Task Force Roster.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* Pilot: July 2015 – June 2017\n* Possible extension: July 2017 – June 2018\n\nYear 1 ‒ Beginning July 2015\n\nMonth 1-3:\n\n* Hire Metadata Coordinator\n* Establish CIC Geospatial Task Force\n* Metadata standard review - examine OGP Metadata Working Group documentation\n* Metadata template creation\n\nMonth 4-9\n\n* Two-day kick-off conference to determine wants/needs/priorities & metadata bootcamp\n* Geoportal software application evaluation (likely before and at the two-day conference)\n    * To include infrastructure hosting and technology management options review by U of Minnesota’s Data & Technology staff\n* Metadata standardization and/or creation at individual institutions\n* Regular check-in meetings with metadata creators\n\nMonth 10-12\n\n* Configure server infrastructure\n* Roll out geoportal instance\n\nYear 2 ‒ Beginning July 2016\n\nMonth 1-3\n\n* Continue to ingest metadata for additional CIC data sets\n* Identify if there are configuration, interface, or custom programming needs and prioritize\n\nMonth 4-12\n\n* Develop and implement high priority configuration, interface, and code enhancements to the core application.\n* Continue to ingest metadata for additional CIC data sets\n* Identify unique CIC resources for possible inclusion in specialized geoportal instance(s)\n    *  Great Lakes data, Agricultural data, Land Use data, etc.\n\nYear 3 ‒ Beginning July 2017 (_prospective_)\n\nMonth 1-6\n\n* Two-day update conference to evaluate progress and facilitate any needed training\n* Coordinate metadata for additional CIC institutions\n* Customize interface instance for additional CIC institutions\n* Customize and launch any specialized geoportal instances\n* Identify any additional custom programming needs\n\nMonth 7-12\n\n* Roll out geoportal instances for additional CIC institutions\n* Evaluate successes, failures, and lessons learned\n* Create a strategic plan for the future of the project\n\n \n\n### Estimated Costs:\n\nDirect cost is $135,000 per year. Cost equally split between all nine participating institutions will be $15,000 per institution per year for two years.\n\nThere will also be in-kind contributions related to staff time for participating institutions. These contributions will vary depending on institutional capacity.\n\n \n\n## Assumptions, Constraints, Risks, Dependencies\n\n### Assumption\n\nLimited emphasis on customization to the geoportal interface in the pilot of the project.\n\n### Constraint\n\nCoordination of metadata standards and creation between nine collaborating institutions will likely be difficult.\n\n### Risk\n\nThe bulk of the work over the first year will take place during fall and spring semesters, which could limit the availability of individuals at the various institutions.\n\n### Dependency\n\nProject success will be dependent on successful collaboration and coordination between all nine participating institutions.\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n\n### Key Deliverables\n\nThe pilot will create a production­-level interface that will act as the primary access point for CIC geospatial data resources, including GIS data, imagery, and scanned historical maps.\n\nAdditional deliverables include a publicly available collection of standardized geospatial metadata relevant to CIC research interests and a set of workflows for collaborative metadata creation.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nPilot evaluation would include an assessment of satisfaction with pilot participants, including an evaluation of workflows and of the interface itself.\n\n## Additional and supporting documents:\n\n* CIC Geospatial Data Discovery Project Memorandum of Understanding [in development]\n* [Proposal for a Geospatial Data Discovery Project Across the CIC]() (February 2015)","src/content/docs/library/cic-charter.md","895038089198fcb5",{"html":928,"metadata":929},"\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"goal-statement\">Goal Statement\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#goal-statement\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Goal Statement”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>This is a collaborative pilot project to provide discoverability, facilitate access, and connect scholars across the CIC to geospatial data resources.

[^1] The initial two years would serve as a pilot ‒ upon a successful evaluation of the effort, the project would seek additional support at a comparable level for an additional year for custom programming, metadata coordination, contribution to the OGP code base, and to facilitate the inclusion of any remaining CIC institutions (see Project Timeline in appendix). If the pilot and subsequent year proves successful, we would seek additional funding after three years to continue the services.\n\n\n[^1]:\tOpen Geoportal is an open source project with no cost to purchase/license the software. \n\n\nWe further propose the creation of a CIC Geospatial Data Task Force responsible for advising the development of the pilot, determining the target minimum number of metadata records to be contributed by each participating institution, serving as liaisons with their home institutions, and coordinating the creation of metadata. The University of Minnesota is poised to take the lead on this project. The U-Spatial program, a campus-wide initiative with the Libraries as a partner, is a logical host for this project, with the Libraries’ Spatial Data Analyst/Curator acting as the project manager during the pilot phase. [^2] A Metadata Coordinator would be hired at the beginning of the pilot phase.\n\n[^2]:\t[http://uspatial.umn.edu/summary](http://uspatial.umn.edu/summary) (scroll down to see partner list)\n\nMuch like the Digital Public Library of America model, OGP is a federated metadata aggregation service, with the added component of a well-designed geographic search interface (see Open Geoportal Overview in appendix). Collective investment in this project will allow the Libraries of the CIC to offer our academic communities a broader array and aggregation of spatial resources metadata, more robust geospatial data services, and the economies of leveraging common infrastructure across institutions. \n\n\n## Deliverables\n\nThe pilot will create a production-level OGP interface that will act as the primary access point for CIC geospatial data resources, including GIS data, imagery, and scanned historical maps. Pilot evaluation would include an assessment of satisfaction with pilot participants, including an evaluation of workflows and of the interface itself. Upon successful evaluation of the pilot, OGP operations moving into the third year (production-level services) would continue to be managed and coordinated by the Metadata Coordinator and the project manager, with guidance from the CIC Geospatial Data Task Force.\n\n\n## Benefits\n\nBenefits of the project include sharing the cost of providing specialized programming, IT infrastructure and support, enabling each institution to showcase their unique resources, allowing discovery of geospatial data resources across the CIC, leveraging the expertise of geospatial and GIS specialists across CIC institutions, and facilitating shared metadata creation, allowing for the future transformation and repurposing of created metadata.\n\n\n## Budget and Contributions\n\nThe pilot funding would be used to fund a 0.25 FTE Spatial Data Analyst/Curator to coordinate the project, as well as to fund a full-time Metadata Coordinator (to manage the process of metadata creation, metadata template creation, and metadata ingest) and host a face-to-face kick-off and planning meeting with CIC Task Force members at which we would set priorities and requirements. The remaining funds would go to technical infrastructure (see Budget in appendix). Aside from funding, each institution would also be responsible for  the creation of metadata for their local datasets and would remain responsible for object/asset storage and access, as OGP only stores the metadata for discovery. \n\n\n## Technical Capacity\n\nSeveral CIC institutions already have active members on the OGP Developers Group or the OGP Metadata Working Group. As such, they will be able to provide technical and operational guidance for this process. The pilot project manager is housed at U-Spatial, which provides technical support and server administration for campus-wide geospatial initiatives. Open Geoportal is an open source, federated discoverability platform that utilizes Apache Solr to store and index metadata records for searching. For the pilot, the application would be hosted on Amazon EC2 servers with metadata XML routinely backed-up to UMN-hosted servers (as per current U-Spatial model). As part of the pilot, we will evaluate University of Minnesota virtual server and storage environment (Cloudnexa) for ongoing infrastructure support. The application itself and the metadata ingest process would be mediated by the pilot project manager. Metadata contributions would conform to one of two main metadata standards for spatial data (FGDC and ISO 19115); either of which can be transformed into the OGP metadata schema. \n\n\n## CIC Context and Collaboration\n\nScholars across academia increasingly demand access to geospatial data to facilitate their research. The 2012 CIC CLI conference ([Finding Our Way: Collaborative Strategies for Developing Geospatial Services](http://www.cic.net/calendar/conferences/library/2012/home)) focused on this demand. A group of CIC geospatial librarians has been working on how to best provide our users access to geospatial data. \n\nCurrently, most CIC libraries employ GIS specialists or librarians.[^3] Including the University of Minnesota, nine CIC institutions have expressed interest in OGP. By collaborating, we can more effectively combine our efforts and expertise for the benefit of the consortium. Based on expressed interest and responses to a readiness survey, proposed participant institutions include: University of Illinois, University of Iowa, University of Maryland, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, University of Minnesota, Pennsylvania State University, Purdue University, and University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\n[^3]:\t[CIC Geospatial Activities Grid](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qDvI91SoO8ZJvHuyH6VBxbspZRRJP4_RZ5NrtkurQE4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOverall, the collaboration will benefit from the investments Minnesota has already made. The University of Minnesota has recently launched a beta version of their Open Geoportal instance, as well as a short video showing the functionality of University of Minnesota’s OGP site.[^4]\n\n[^4]:\t[http://z.umn.edu/libogp](http://z.umn.edu/libogp) & [http://z.umn.edu/umnogpvideo](http://z.umn.edu/umnogpvideo) (note: no sound)\n\n**_Cost Model_**\n\nIf each participating institution were to individually implement OGP, likely costs would include a manager, developer time, and other infrastructure support (approximately $360,000/year for nine institutions). By coalescing resources, considerable savings can be achieved over the course of the project.\n\n**_Funding Model:_**\n\n* Each of the nine CIC participant institutions would contribute $15,000/year. \n* Institutions would commit to the 2-year pilot, with potential for 3\u003Csup>rd\u003C/sup> year extension.\n* If the pilot and subsequent year proves successful, we would seek additional funding after three years to continue the services. The cost to provide OGP services is expected to remain fairly consistent over time.\n\n**_Governance Model:_**\n\n* A CIC OGP Task Force, comprised of representatives from each participating institution, would be formed to oversee the project and guide policy and governance decisions.\n* The Task Force will advise on project management and software development, coordinate training and best practice standards for participants, and stay apprised of national OGP activities\n* OGP is an open source project using the GNU GPL v3 license. It is the intent that any development work would be contributed to the OGP project along with all rights.\n\n\n## Joining a National Movement\n\nOGP has been adopted by a number of prominent institutions. The strength and popularity of the OGP community is well documented and includes 30 partner institutions. [^5] As of January 2015, there are six public instances of OGP. OGP projects have also been the recipient of grants from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, for technology development and a governance summit, and a National Leadership Grant from IMLS, for the University of New Hampshire PLACE project.\n\n[^5]: [http://opengeoportal.org/events/](http://opengeoportal.org/events/) (scroll down to see partner list)\n\nA node of universities on the east coast has emerged as a multi-institution prototype and several institutions in California are OGP partners. _The CIC is perfectly placed to take leadership in forming a midwest node._ The project manager would serve as an active member in the national OGP community by contributing to the further enhancement of this open source collaboration.\n\n\n## Appendix\n\n\n### Project Timeline\n\nYear 1 ‒ Beginning July 2015\n\nMonth 1-3:\n\n* Hire Metadata Coordinator\n* Establish CIC Geospatial Task Force\n* Metadata standard review - examine OGP Metadata Working Group documentation\n* Two-day kick-off conference to determine wants/needs/priorities & metadata bootcamp\n* Metadata template creation\n\nMonth 4-9\n\n* Metadata standardization and/or creation at individual institutions\n* Regular check-in meetings with metadata creators\n* OGP interface customization\n\nMonth 10-12\n\n* Configure server infrastructure\n* Roll out OGP instance\n\nYear 2 ‒ Beginning July 2016\n\nMonth 1-3\n\n* Continue to ingest metadata for additional CIC data sets\n*Identify if there are custom programming needs and prioritize\n\nMonth 4-12\n\n* Work with contract programmers to facilitate changes\n* Continue to ingest metadata for additional CIC data sets\n* Identify unique CIC resources for possible inclusion in specialized OGP instance(s): Great Lakes data, Agricultural data, Land Use data, etc.\n\nYear 3 ‒ Beginning July 2017 (_prospective_)\n\nMonth 1-6\n\n* Two-day update conference to evaluate progress and facilitate any needed training\n* Coordinate metadata for additional CIC institutions\n* Customize OGP instance for additional CIC institutions\n* Customize and launch any specialized OGP instances\n* Identify any additional custom programming needs\n\n\nMonth 7-12\n\n* Roll out OGP instances for additional CIC institutions\n* Evaluate successes, failures, and lessons learned\n* Create a strategic plan for the future of the project\n\n## Project Budget \n\n($135,000/year)\n\nYear 1 Total: $135,000 \n\nPersonnel: $95,000\n\n* UMN Spatial Data Analyst/Curator (¼ time)\n* Metadata Coordinator (full-time)\n* Graduate assistant (1 GA, ¼ time in fall) \n\nTechnical Infrastructure:$20,000\n\n* Computer hardware (desktops/laptops)\n* Secure Amazon Web Hosting (Cloudnexa)\n\nCollaboration costs (meetings, communications): $20,000\n\n* Kick-off conference (travel, lodging & meals - 16 x $1000/person)\n* GIS & Metadata person from each institution\n* Two day kick-off conference logistical costs\n* Virtual meetings\n\n \n\n\nYear 2 Total: $135,000 :\n\nPersonnel: $95,000\n\n* UMN Spatial Data Analyst/Curator (¼ time)\n* Metadata Coordinator (full-time)\n* Graduate assistant (1 GA, ½ time in summer)\n\nSpecialized Programming (contract out): $25,000 \n\nTechnical Infrastructure: $15,000\n\n* Computer hardware maintenance (desktops/laptops)\n* Secure Amazon Web Hosting (Cloudnexa)\n\nYear 3 Total: $135,000  (_prospective_):\n\nPersonnel: $100,000\n\n* UMN Spatial Data Analyst/Curator (¼ time)\n* Metadata Coordinator (full-time)\n* Graduate assistant (1 GA, ¼ time in fall) \n\nTechnical Infrastructure: $15,000\n\n* Computer hardware maintenance (desktops/laptops)\n* Secure Amazon Web Hosting (Cloudnexa)\n\nCollaboration costs (meetings, communications): $20,000\n\n* Update conference (travel, lodging & meals - 16 x $1000/person)\n* GIS & Metadata person from each institution\n* Two day conference logistical costs\n\n\n## Open Geoportal Overview\n\nTechnology diagram\n\n![alt_text](@images/ogp-diagram.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\nUser interface showing previewable data (roads in red) and extent (blue box) of data for item highlighted in the menu at left\n\n![alt_text](@images/ogp-search.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\n---\n\n*Attachment: Letter of support from Patrick Florance, Director, The Open Geoportal Project.*\n\n\n\u003C!-- Footnotes themselves at the bottom. -->\n## Notes","src/content/docs/library/cic-proposal.md",[1019,1020],"@images/ogp-diagram.png","@images/ogp-search.png","d74b430f25a5716a",{"html":1023,"metadata":1024},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>February 2015\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ctable>\n  \u003Ctbody>\u003Ctr>\n   \u003Ctd>Mara Blake\n\u003Cp>\nSpatial &#x26; Numeric Data Librarian\n\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\nClark Library\n\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\nUniversity of Michigan\n   \u003C/p>\u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>Len Kne\n\u003Cp>\nAssociate Director\n\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\nU-Spatial\n\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\nUniversity of Minnesota\n   \u003C/p>\u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>Ryan Mattke\n\u003Cp>\nHead,\n\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\nJohn R.

Executive Summary\n\nThe fifth annual Big Ten GIS Conference, hosted virtually on April 11, 2025, set new records for participation and engagement. Organized by the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Information Network (BTAA-GIN), the event tripled registrations from 2023 and brought together students, faculty, researchers, librarians, and professionals to share innovative work and build cross-institutional connections.\n\n## Wins at a Glance\n    \n* 664 registrants from 230+ institutions; presentation submissions more than doubled\n* 220+ peak attendees and 262 unique participants throughout the day\n* 37% student attendance, followed by state and local government professionals\n* 40% from GIN member universities, with strong turnout from Michigan, Purdue, Ohio State, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Washington, and Pennsylvania State\n* Opening remarks by Maurice York (BTAA) highlighted the value of Big Ten collaboration and BTAA-GIN infrastructure\n* Keynote by Dr. Emily Fairfax (UMN) on climate resilience received high praise\n* Workshop by Matt Forrest offered practical insights into emerging geospatial technologies\n* Three sessions and lightning talk block delivered strong and diverse presentations\n* BTAA-GIN resources, including the Geoportal, were promoted throughout the event\n\n## 2025 Improvements\n\n* A formal proposal review process improved speaker quality and representation\n* A rebranded identity with consistent visuals across all materials\n* Expanded outreach, including targeted emails to 72 organizations, listservs, and social\n\n## Challenges & Lessons Learned\n\n* Too few volunteers led to long shifts; we’ll expand the team in 2026 to reduce burnout\n* Zoom Webinar limited backstage coordination; future events will revisit Zoom Events \n* Some GIN universities had minimal participation; we will set clearer expectations to ensure all 17 institutions are actively involved in planning, outreach, and execution\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nThe 2026 conference is scheduled for April, providing a full year of lead time. Earlier outreach—particularly to faculty—will help boost student and campus-wide participation.\n\nThe strong growth and success of this year’s event reflect the momentum of the BTAA-GIN network and its ongoing value and influence in advancing geospatial research, shared infrastructure, and collaboration across the Big Ten and beyond.\n\n## 2025 Conference Planning Group\n\n\"BTAA-GIN Conference team\"\n\n**Committee Members**\n\n* Colleen Wilson (Chair), BTAA-GIN Associate Director, University of Minnesota\n* Karen Majewicz, BTAA-GIN Associate Director, University of Minnesota\n* Laura Kane McElfresh, Cartographic Metadata Librarian, University of Minnesota\n* Daniel Dobson, Map Librarian, Ohio State University\n* Nicole Scholtz, Librarian for Geospatial and Numeric Data, University of Michigan\n* Sue Oldenburg, GIS Specialist, Rutgers University-New Brunswick\n* Kathleen Weessies, Head, Map Library, Michigan State University\n\n**Volunteers**\n\n* Mech Frazier, GIS & Cartographic Specialist, Northwestern University\n* Tara Anthony, GIS Specialist, Pennsylvania State University","src/content/docs/library/conference-report-2025.md","f9cb07f87abbb249",{"html":1079,"metadata":1080},"\u003Cp>Issued: May 1, 2025\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#executive-summary\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Executive Summary”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>The fifth annual Big Ten GIS Conference, hosted virtually on April 11, 2025, set new records for participation and engagement.

It is open to all participants, including those outside the BTAA network. \n\nThe 4th annual conference was held on November 8th, 2023. The conference spanned the hours of 9:00 AM to 4:10 PM Central Standard Time. The schedule included:\n*   Short Introduction (5 minutes)\n*   Keynote (1 hour)\n*   Two Lightning Talks sessions (50 minutes each)\n*   Three Presentation Sessions (1 hour each)\n\n## Conference Statistics 2023\n\n* Number of registrations: 212\n* Number of unique attendees: 132\n* Number of presenters: 21\n* Max Concurrent Views: 76\n\n**Organization type by attendee:**\n\n* university: 177\n* government: 19\n* private/nonprofit: 12\n* other: 4\n* Universities represented: nearly 40\n\n## Keynote Speech\n\nOur keynote speaker was **Katie McDonough**, who called in from the Alan Turing Institute in London, UK. She presented “Reading Maps: Making, Searching, and Interpreting Text on Maps.“ The BTAA-GIN provided a $1000 honorarium, which was the only expense incurred by the conference outside of in-kind staff time.\n\n## BTAA GIS Conference 2023 Planning Group\n\n\n\n**BTAA-GIN Planning Group**\n\n*   Karen Majewicz (Chair), Geospatial Project Manager, University of Minnesota\n*   Caroline Kayko, Map and Geospatial Data Librarian, University of Michigan\n*   Laura Kane McElfresh, Cartographic Metadata Librarian, University of Minnesota\n*   Josh Sadvari, Geospatial Information Librarian, Ohio State University\n*   Nicole Scholtz, Librarian for Geospatial and Numeric Data, University of Michigan\n*   Jay Bowen, GIS Specialist, University of Iowa\n*   Sue Oldenburg, GIS Specialist, Rutgers University-New Brunswick\n*   Kathleen Weessies, Head, Map Library, Michigan State University\n\n**BTAA staff**\n\n* Susanne Garrison, Community Coordinator\n* Tim Newcomb, Operations Coordinator\n\nThe BTAA-GIN Conference Planning Group met 7 times between July and November. We also had three tech rehearsals with the BTAA IT team. The planning group divided up roles and responsibilities by identifying task leads, including communicating with the keynote speaker, managing the website pages, issuing proposals, putting the conference agenda together, building the map gallery, coordinating Zoom, and editing the videos.\n\nWe used a planning spreadsheet to keep track of our work: [2023 BTAA GIS Conference Planning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14EqhfGZwYZ2daYfg_tCY9DA9weGKsHfhQ1fRVlkwWIw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Key Takeaways (2023)\n\n### Plusses\n:material-plus: Reach of the conference continues beyond the day-of event via YouTube videos, viewed increasingly over time.\n\n:material-plus: The BTAA IT partners were wonderful and went above and beyond to help us: three tech rehearsals and staying online the whole time to manage the Zoom.\n\n:material-plus: The technical aspect of the conference ran very smoothly. Our new system of having a facilitator and slide-runner made transitions easier and faster.\n\n:material-plus: Served as an augmentation to local GIS Days\n\n:material-plus:The new [Map Gallery](https://gin.btaa.org/Map-Gallery-Update/) is easy to use and links to all years.\n\n:material-plus:The videos were processed very quickly, because of a new role for a dedicated video person.\n\n### Minuses\n:material-minus: We needed at least three people for each session and did not have enough volunteers to fill each slot\n\n:material-minus: The day of the event was somewhat tiring for the facilitators and moderators\n\n:material-minus: We did not feel empowered to create things like branded swag or gifts\n\n### Planned changes for next year\n:material-delta: Considering moving conference to spring: there are fewer conflicting events and this would give us a longer lead-up time to promote and coordinate\n\n:material-delta: Simplify communications with more batch emails and possibly implementing tools like a Contact Relations Database and/or an email marketing platform.\n\n:material-delta: Present more information and highlights about the BTAA-GIN and the Geoportal in the welcoming remarks","src/content/docs/library/conference-report-2023.md","d9877218698f13c5",{"html":1117,"metadata":1118},"\u003Cp>Issued: December 21, 2023\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"summary\">Summary\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#summary\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Summary”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Established in 2020, the BTAA GIS Conference is a virtual event organized by geospatial information users and educators in Big Ten institutions to present their work, exchange information, and develop potential collaborations.

The next two years will solidify operations of an established and sustainable production service, continue the growth of the collection of geospatial metadata records, and complete exploration of expanded strategic directions. This expansion may require an increase in funding beyond the requested two-year investment, which would be presented in a revised Year 6 budget proposal.\n\n## Project Context\n\nThe Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal is one of a handful of geoportals maintained by academic institutions across the United States. Others include [OpenGeoportal](http://data.opengeoportal.org/), [Earthworks](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/), and [NYU Spatial Data Repository](https://geo.nyu.edu/). As of October 2018, the BTAA project has contributed nearly 9,000 metadata records to [OpenGeoMetadata](https://github.com/OpenGeoMetadata), a large-scale aggregation of geospatial metadata from many different institutions. By participating in the broader geospatial metadata ecosystem, these records can now be utilized by other geoportals to allow discovery and access for geospatial data resources from nine states within the Big Ten Academic Alliance. \n\n## Assessment of project to date and emerging areas of focus \n\nGeospatial data are notoriously hard to find using standard web search engines. The main barrier is that the user needs to know who generates the type of data they are looking for and seek out that entity’s website to find datasets. With the Geoportal, a user does not need to know who created the data in order to find it. Users can focus on searching by What, When, and Where. They do not have to worry about Who or Why. The Geoportal has already made significant progress in this regard, having aggregated metadata from nearly 80 different data portals and map collections and augmented it by assigning subjects, dates, place names, and bounding box coordinates to each record. \n\nThere are three concerns in the project as currently scoped that present opportunities for increased focus for the next two years:\n\n### 1. The Geoportal is not yet a well-known resource, because it has not been effectively promoted.\n\nAddressing this issue would not necessitate an expansion in project scope. The Task Force members plan to focus on outreach and promotion by creating and implementing a detailed Communications Plan, and by working directly with communications professionals and subject liaisons at participating BTAA institutions. They will also gather focused input from faculty, researchers, students, and other user communities.\n\n### 2. Public geospatial data are alarmingly unstable. \n\nGovernment data providers regularly migrate, update, delete, and re-publish data. These practices result in broken access links in the Geoportal. One solution to this problem to be explored is archiving and preserving the data in a spatial data repository to ensure stable and persistent access. Addressing this issue would necessitate an expansion in project scope (see below).\n\n### 3. Expected changes in the technology development and support personnel for the BTAA Geoportal. \n\nThe University of Minnesota expects a significant reduction in the availability of the Geoportal's lead (but part-time) developer in early 2019. This has prompted opportunity to take stock of the project's technology support needs moving into the next few years. Maintaining high technical reliability and performance alongside accelerated feature and service development are priorities. To do so, Minnesota plans to combine its current in-kind funding commitment for a part-time developer (at the 0.35FTE to 0.50FTE level) with the project's accrual of budgeted technology funds for contracted software development to appoint a 0.75FTE to 1.0FTE GeoBlacklight developer over the next two years (see Project Budget section for detailed numbers). This will increase the technology support capacities of the project without increasing costs to participating institutions.\n\n## Continuing exploration of a strategic expansion in scope\n\n### 1. Archiving and preservation.\n\nAlthough the project has compiled information on the spatial data archiving and preservation capabilities at participating universities, it is not clear where the priority rests for developing such a capability BTAA-wide, and/or for creating it for the institutions that currently lack it. To determine this, additional conversations are needed, including with libraries administrations. This will also provide an opportunity to interface and collaborate with local, county, regional, and state government agencies who produce the geospatial data. Creating formal archiving agreements with government data providers would enhance reliability, but add complexity. \n\n### 2. Web services.\n\nThe project’s stakeholders have expressed enthusiasm for developing a collaborative solution to provide online geospatial web services. These would allow users to access and visualize geospatial data in a web browser or mapping application without the need for specialized software. \n\n### 3. Licensed data. \n\nMany participating institutions hold licensed geospatial data that they wish to submit to the geoportal. Incorporating these types of resources would present challenges in terms of enabling multiple institutional authentication protocols that will require specialized technical research. One possibility would be the Shared Big Data Gateway project (CADRE).\n\n## Progress towards Years 3 & 4 project goals\n\nProgress on goals to guide new development of program areas, in addition to continued support and refinement of established operations (see Appendices C & D for additional details): \n\n### 1. Sustainability, Maturation, and Strategic Planning\n\n* reorganized governance to appoint a UMN Product Owner, to create more structured topical committees, and to charge short term working groups \n* created a [Technology Stack Matrix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q5ZMF4k1s3rfcl3A2qY6hiPBCd-IstdAf_huQwtl9hY/edit?usp=sharing) identifying the existing technology infrastructure at each institution for data archiving, preservation, and discovery services\n* convened a Strategic Leadership Group \n* Project Lead convened a series of meetings involving geoportal representatives from NYU, Princeton, and Stanford\n\n    \n### 2. Collection Development\n\n* drafted a [Collection Development Policy](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NBDEAZA88LET4g2ZsfrmfTwIUoVJHepv) and [Collections Strategic Work Plan](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1n9rg7x7jeEO3TkppJOIMogO6S8M9SWWq) \n* conducted an updated inventory of open data portals/websites across the Big Ten \n* grew the collection to over 15,000 records (see Appendix A)\n\n\n### 3. Geospatial community outreach and education\n\n* presented geospatial metadata workshops at local and national conferences, including collaboration with librarians from Stanford and NYU\n* 4 published articles and 16 presentations or posters at national or international conferences (see Appendix B)\n* Product Owner facilitated monthly GeoBlacklight Developer Meetings \n* participated in GeoBlacklight Community Code Sprints\n* contributed significant code and documentation to the GeoBlacklight code base \n* gathered [user stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ixn9e3cRsswztf8NlhKPcMM9Tnm2JPlHX1ScHwvSs-g/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Project Budget\n\nYear 5 (July 2019 - June 2020) and Year 6 (July 2020 - June 2021)\n\nNote: Detailed budget documents available upon request.\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Appendix A: Geoportal Statistics\n\n#### Geoportal use statistics (August 2016 - September 2018):\n\n* Unique users: 13,074\n* Page views: 125,541\n* Sessions: 20,458\n* Downloads: 4,261\n\n#### City location of users (13,074 unique users)\n\n* Users from 2,176 different cities in 111 countries\n* Top cities: Minneapolis, Ann Arbor, Madison, Unknown, Chicago, Ashburn, Paris, State College, Columbus, New York, Bloomington, St. Paul, College Park, East Lansing, Philadelphia, West Lafayette, Washington, Iowa City, Champaign\n\n#### Search terms (4,640 unique searches)\n\n* Top terms: water, minnesota, asia, parks, chicago, census, health, ann arbor, lakes, wisconsin, michigan, indiana, india, minneapolis, ohio, parcels, ypsilanti, detroit, population.\n\n#### Downloads (4,261)\n\n* 1,449 different data sets downloaded\n* Top downloads:\n * [Census Tracts: Hennepin County, Minnesota, 2010](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/62bf3dd96fda4bd49e40574ccbaa7653_1)\n * [City of Ann Arbor, Washtenaw County Michigan](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/c0b81609-f233-4004-a5de-6e86ebdace1e)\n * [Campus Facilities - UMD Buildings: Maryland](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/796da1bbb93e4f65a796de7dba4ba5b9_2)\n * [C-04 Geologic atlas of Hennepin County, Minnesota](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/d1316ee8-8968-4156-9185-87a9433fe9ba)\n * [Agricultural Chemical Incidents: Minnesota](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/8f9c3446-00cc-409d-bddd-c87231d3dc94)\n\n#### Number of data sets and scanned maps by source\n\n* Geospatial data sets: 8,979\n * Dataset sources:\n     * University Library/Repository: 417\n     * State: 3,350\n     * County: 2,723\n     * City: 1,963\n     * Other: 526\n* Scanned maps: 6,178\n * From nine institutional repositories\n* Number of sources (portals/libraries): 76\n\n#### Proportion of Geospatial Data Records in the Geoportal by Administration Source\n\n![by Administration Source](@images/admin-source.png)\n\n#### Number of Geospatial Datasets in the Geoportal by Subject Category\n\n![by Subject Category](@images/subject.png)\n\n#### Total Number of Records in the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal \n\n(August 2016-October 2018)\n\n![growth-2016-2018](@images/growth-2016-2018.png)\n\n\n#### Survey of participating institutions indicating types of geospatial data maintained in their library\n\n![alt_text](@images/types-of-data.png)\n\n\n### Appendix B: Geoportal Scholarship\n\nScholarship involving the BTAA Geospatial Data Project has resulted in an initial white paper, four published articles, and 16 presentations or posters at national or international conferences. \n\nScholarly Articles:\n\n* Battista, A., Majewicz, K., Balogh, S., & Hardy, D.

This has prompted opportunity to take stock of the project’s technology support needs moving into the next few years. Maintaining high technical reliability and performance alongside accelerated feature and service development are priorities. To do so, Minnesota plans to combine its current in-kind funding commitment for a part-time developer (at the 0.35FTE to 0.50FTE level) with the project’s accrual of budgeted technology funds for contracted software development to appoint a 0.75FTE to 1.0FTE GeoBlacklight developer over the next two years (see Project Budget section for detailed numbers).

The main goal for the next two years is to support and strengthen current operations and services. To accomplish that goal, we will continue to grow the collection of geospatial metadata records, develop related content for teaching and learning, and perform outreach to both data providers and consumers. To advance longer-term strategic aims of the project, such as the expansion of our partnership and service models, we are actively seeking external funding, which includes the submission of an IMLS National Leadership Grant preliminary proposal. \n\n\n## Context\n\nThe Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal is the only consortial geoportal maintained by collaboration between academic institutions in the United States. Only a handful of individual universities, including Stanford, Princeton, Harvard, and NYU, have been able to build a similar geoportal for their campus affiliates. As of October 2020, the BTAA Geoportal collection has grown to nearly 36,000 records allowing discovery and access for geospatial data resources from ten states within the Big Ten Academic Alliance. We also provide leadership in the Geo4LibCamp and GeoBlacklight international communities by hosting monthly meetings, contributing to the open-source code base, and forming cross-institutional workgroups.\n\n\n## Progress\n\nOver the last two years, in addition to day-to-day operations of the geoportal, we addressed several areas of focus: \n\n### 1. Teaching & Learning \n\n* Geoportal Tutorials - for use by librarians, instructors, and students\n* Help & FAQs - to facilitate ease of use for the Geoportal\n    \n### 2. Outreach\n\n* BTAA GIS Conference - online conference with over 400 registrants from 10 countries\n* Blog Posts - collection highlights and data provider interviews\n\n    \n### 3. Assessment & Usage\n\n* Five Year Impact Report - demonstrates the project’s qualitative effects\n* Increase in monthly users year over year\n\n    \n### 4. Technology & Infrastructure\n\n* Built a custom [geospatial metadata editor](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geomg)\n* Contributed about 500 hours to the development of GeoBlacklight code\n* Serving as the first [Community Coordinator](https://geoblacklight.org/about/) for the GeoBlacklight Community\n\n\n## Future Activities\n\nWe plan to continue working on: \n\n* Licensed Data - will be included in the Geoportal starting in early 2021\n* Additional Help Pages and Advanced Tutorials\n* [Diverse Collections Working Group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_lFlwsvqfs-Vtcr8OHoRGJA88MLApXkvY_sHR6bqOIQ/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n\n## Growth Potential\n\nWe are exploring opportunities for long term sustainability and strategic growth. Guided by a Strategic Leadership Group active from 2018-2020, we have developed a plan that expands our partnership and service models. To this end, we have submitted a preliminary proposal for an IMLS grant that would provide the funding needed to propel us to this next step.\n\n## Project Budget\n\nYear 7 (July 2021 - June 2022) and Year 8 (July 2022 - June 2023)\n\n*The project has $170,000 in reserve that was previously designated for web hosting and software development (which has been provided in-kind by the University of Minnesota for Years 1-6 of the project). The previous budget (Years 5 & 6) proposed to utilize that reserve to fund an increased level of developer effort. An attempt was made to hire a developer position, but that search failed. Since April 2020, UMN has been prohibited from recruiting or appointing new positions. We intend to return to our original plan of recruiting a software developer when conditions permit.\n\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Appendix A: Geoportal Statistics (2016-2020)\n\n* Percentage of users who found the Geoportal through a search engine: 48%\n* Usage numbers: 33,146 users and 263,101 pageviews\n* User locations: 3508 cities in 128 countries\n* Top 10 user cities: Minneapolis, Chicago, Ashburn, Madison, Ann Arbor, New York, Columbus, Bloomington, Evansville, Washington\n* Top 10 search terms: water, minnesota, parks, PLSS, asia, census, trout, chicago, wisconsin, health\n* Most viewed item: _Wisconsin Historic Aerial Imagery Finder (Aerial Photos 1937-41)_: 1,770 views\n* Total number of all item downloads: 9,868\n* Most downloaded item: _Campus Facilities - UMD Parking Lots: Maryland_: 120 downloads\n\nChart: Monthly Geoportal Users & Pageviews\n\n\n![2016-2021](@images/2016-2021.png)\n\n_Since launching in 2016, the Geoportal has had a slowly rising base of users and pageviews, with usage patterns following the academic calendar. However, there has been a marked increase in 2020, possibly attributable to the growing collection size, the shift to online instruction, and the BTAA GIS Virtual Conference._\n\n\n### Appendix B: Key Project Milestones\n\n#### 2015\n\nHeld kickoff meeting\n\nFirst in-person project summit for Task Force with nine institutions\n\nHired metadata coordinator to develop metadata workflow \n\n\n#### 2016\n\nIndiana University joined \n\nLaunched BTAA Geoportal\n\nMetadata, Collection Development, and Interface Committees formed\n\nCompleted first round of usability testing for geoportal\n\n\n#### 2017\n\nChicago and Ohio State joined \n\nSecond in-person project summit resulting in a new governance model \n\nStrategic Leadership Group (SLG) formed\n\nBegan contributing to the GeoBlacklight community \n\n\n#### 2018\n\nCommunications Committee formed \n\nGeoportal record count hit 10,000 \n\nConducted second round of usability testing \n\nArcGIS Working Group and Analytics Working Group released project guidelines\n\nImplemented thumbnails and advanced search\n\n\n#### 2019\n\nUpgraded to GeoBlacklight 2.0\n\nGeoportal record count hit 20,000 \n\nAdded an Open in ArcGIS button, tooltips, and a citation widget\n\nBegan holding regular communications blog sprints\n\nSLG in-person meeting to discuss expansion and sustainability\n\nLicensed Data pilot began\n\n\n#### 2020\n\nUniversity of Nebraska joined\n\nHeld two metadata sprints\n\nGeoportal record count hit 30,000 \n\nReleased Impact Report\n\nReleased six tutorials\n\nOrganized and hosted the first BTAA GIS Conference\n\nDeveloped a custom metadata editor\n\n\n??? info \"Appendix C: Geoportal Scholarship\"\n\nScholarship involving the BTAA Geospatial Data Project has resulted in an initial white paper, four published articles, and 16 presentations or posters at national or international conferences. \n\nScholarly Articles\n\nMajewicz, K., Martindale, J., Kernik, M.

Geospatial Data Project’s successes in its first six years, we propose maintaining the investment level of $15,000 per institution for each of the next two years (with thirteen participating institutions, this would total $195,000 per year). The main goal for the next two years is to support and strengthen current operations and services. To accomplish that goal, we will continue to grow the collection of geospatial metadata records, develop related content for teaching and learning, and perform outreach to both data providers and consumers. To advance longer-term strategic aims of the project, such as the expansion of our partnership and service models, we are actively seeking external funding, which includes the submission of an IMLS National Leadership Grant preliminary proposal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"context\">Context\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#context\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Context”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>The Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal is the only consortial geoportal maintained by collaboration between academic institutions in the United States.

However, there are opportunities for internal collaborations, including with Special Collections librarians or other local digital collections initiatives. These collaborations can allow for unique and distinctive maps to be harvested into the geoportal across our universities.\n\nFor geospatial data, datasets created in association with research projects at our institutions may be a high priority based on content or theme.

For example, in April 2020, a call went out to all task force members to identify and submit content related to COVID-19 for harvesting into the geoportal. Content that aligns with other ongoing BTAA-GIN program efforts, such as the Diverse Collections Working Group, will also be a higher priority as these efforts are further developed.\n\n\n## Administration\n\nCollections may be prioritized based on the organization responsible for creating and maintaining content, which impacts the types of maps or datasets available to be harvested, spatial and temporal coverage, and stability. Based on these considerations, current priorities in terms of administration are:\n\n1. University libraries and archives\n\t* Links to these resources are likely to be stable\n\t* Resources will likely be documented with a metadata standard\n\t* Represent our core audience\n\n2. States and counties\n\t* Produce most foundational geospatial datasets (e.g., roads and parcels) and are currently our largest source of geospatial data\n\t* Technology and open data policies vary widely resulting in patchwork coverage\n\n3. Regional organizations and research institutes\n\t* Often special organizations with funding to create geospatial data across political boundaries\n\t* Higher risk of harvesting duplicate datasets, as these organizations sometimes aggregate records from cities, counties, or state agencies\n\n4. Cities\n\t* less likely to produce and share data in geospatial formats and more likely to share tabular data\n\t* prioritized cities: major metropolitan areas and the locations of our university campuses\n\n## Technology\n\nThe source's hosting platform influences the ease of harvesting, the quality of the metadata, and the stability of the access links. Based on these considerations, current priorities in terms of technology are:\n\n1. Published via known portal or digital library platforms, including:\n\t* Blacklight/GeoBlacklight\n\t* Islandora\n\t* Preservica\n\t* ArcGIS Hubs\n\t* Socrata\n\t* CKAN\n\t* Sites with OAI-PMH enabled APIs\n\n2.

Static webpages with download links\n\t* at a minimum, a title is required for each item\n\t* static sites with nested links take a long time to process and may require an extensive amount of manual work\n\n4.

The next two years will solidify operations of an established and sustainable production service and will direct attention towards exploring a strategic expansion in scope.\n\n## Goals Summary\n\nFor Years 3 & 4, we propose the following goals (see detailed descriptions below) to guide new development of program areas, _in addition to continued support and refinement of established operations_:\n\n\n1. Sustainability -- Develop a sustainable model for service operations \n2. Collection Development -- Grow the collection of geospatial metadata guided by the development of collection development policies and planning\n3. Geospatial metadata outreach and education -- Leverage expertise within the project to grow expertise in the broader GIS community\n4. Strategic Planning -- Assess potential areas of strategic expansion in scope and establish our role in the larger geospatial metadata ecosystem\n\n## Project Context\n\nThe Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal is one of a handful of geoportals maintained by academic institutions across the United States. Others include [OpenGeoportal](http://data.opengeoportal.org/), [Earthworks](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/), and [NYU Spatial Data Repository](https://geo.nyu.edu/). As of January 2017, the BTAA project has contributed over 4,400 metadata records to [OpenGeoMetadata](https://github.com/OpenGeoMetadata), a large-scale aggregation of geospatial metadata from many different institutions (see a detailed current project summary in Appendix A). By participating in the broader geospatial metadata ecosystem, these records can now be utilized by other geoportals to allow discovery and access for geospatial data resources from eight states within the Big Ten Academic Alliance. \n\nAs the project unfolds, a preservation dimension for these data is emerging. The BTAA Geospatial Data Task Force, as well as the broader GeoBlacklight community, see a need for archiving, preservation, and access for at-risk geospatial data resources. These born digital resources are not being systematically archived by the government agencies that produce the data, as their mission is to provide researchers, citizens, and other users with access to the most recent data. As government funding remains flat or declines, recent historical data are often at risk of being lost. Locally produced research data may have continuing research value, but data producers lack a scalable preservation solution. Developing a preservation solution for these data will require significant additional resources and, potentially, collaboration with a broader group of stakeholders, and is therefore a possible future strategic direction that will take time to explore.\n\n## Detailed Project Goals\n\nYears 3 & 4 (July 2017 - June 2019)\n\nFinalization of Year 4 goals is expected to be informed by findings and deliberations in Year 3 and will be presented to BTAA Library Directors in early 2018.\n\n\n### 1. Sustainability\n\n#### 1\\. Develop a Sustainable, Strategic Plan (Year 3)\n\nA key outcome for year three is a plan to sustain the project within its current scope as an established production service. This will include planning for long-term project sustainability, laying out options for baseline maintenance of the geoportal. An additional outcome will be identifying possible new strategic goals that leverage the collaborative's expertise, infrastructure, and data aggregation. \n\nThis strategic goal-setting will consider archiving and preservation of “at-risk” geospatial data for states represented by the Big Ten Academic Alliance, including the technical infrastructure to make the data sets available via GeoServer or similar. Archiving and preservation of data would also likely necessitate engagement and relationship development with data producers. Additional funding would likely be necessary for a strategic goal involving archiving and preservation.\n\nFocused discussions on strategic goals will take place at a Project Summit (attended by the project Task Force) in late Summer or early Fall 2017. The feedback from the first Project Summit (Fall 2015) was overwhelmingly positive and demonstrated the combined interest in the project from across the BTAA. Participants were energized and excited by the summit and enthusiastic about future work on the project. A second in-person meeting of the entire Task Force will include these objectives:\n\n* Outline options for a sustainable plan for Year 3 and beyond\n* Outline options for a strategic plan for beyond Year 3\n* Evaluate successes, failures, and lessons learned\n* Engage in training and skill building for Task Force members\n* Enhance relationships and community building within the Task Force\n\n**Lead**: Proposed Strategic Leadership Group (see 4a below) with the addition of someone with sustainability planning experience (from one of the member institutions).\n\n#### 2\\. Maintain and Support Current Activities (Year 3 & Year 4)\n\nThough much of the initial work has been done, activities to maintain and sustain the Geoportal going forward will involve:\n\n* Workflow and process improvement and documentation\n* Metadata curation, creation, and coordination for additional data sets\n* Continued promotion and outreach through conference presentations\n* Geoportal interface enhancements and maintenance\n* Ongoing outreach to user communities\n\n**Lead:** UMN Metadata Coordinator\n\n### 2. Collection Development\n\n#### 1\\. Create a collection development policy and strategic plan (Year 3)\n\nDevelop a policy and plan for collection growth with a specific focus on defining what constitutes the BTAA geospatial research collection as a comprehensive geospatial data research collection in the context of the broader geospatial metadata ecosystem.\n\n**Lead:** Task Force Member (To be identified from Collection Development Steering Group)\n\n#### 2\\. Explore the Integration of Metadata Records for Licensed Data (Year 3)\n\nTask Force members have expressed a high level of interest in adding metadata records to the Geoportal for licensed resources purchased at individual institutions for use by their patrons. Potential inclusion will greatly increase discoverability of these resources, even if access is not available for all users. Exploration will include investigating costs, potential technical challenges involved, how licensed data are hosted at each institution, and the different authentication protocols used at each institution.\n\n**Lead:** Task Force Member (To be identified from Collection Development or Metadata Steering Group)\n\n#### 3\\. Integrate Metadata Records for Licensed Data in the Geoportal (Year 4)\n\nIf the exploration in Year 3 concludes that integration of licensed data is feasible and supportable within the project budget, implementation would be pursued in Year 4. Should cost exceed currently available budget, implementation will be included in the proposal for year 4 and beyond.\n\n**Lead:** Task Force Member (Collection Development or Metadata Steering Group)\n\n#### 4\\. Focus on Unique Data (Year 4)\n\nFocus on making specific sets or collections of data discoverable to the wider research community, with an emphasis on geospatial data pertinent to researchers within the Big Ten Academic Alliance. Possibilities would include Great Lakes data, Agricultural data, and Land Use data.\n\n**Lead:** Task Force Member (Collection Development Steering Group)\n\n### 3. Geospatial metadata outreach and education\u003C/span>\n    \n#### 1. Address Metadata Needs in the Broader GIS Community (Year 3)\n\nWork in this area will include outreach and training for GIS Professionals in order to showcase the need for more complete metadata, encourage the creation of more useful metadata, and show the benefits of better metadata. The outreach and training will focus on current geospatial data producers so that future metadata harvests for ingest into the geoportal would require less metadata remediation by Task Force members.\n\n**Lead:** UMN Metadata Coordinator\n\n####2\\. Create a lightweight, cloud-based metadata creation tool (Year 4)\n\nFund programming/development work to create a tool to facilitate low-barrier metadata entry.\n\n**Lead:** Task Force Member (Metadata Steering Group)\n\n### 4. Strategic Planning\n\n#### 1. Formation of a Higher Level Strategy Group (Year 3)\n\nShould the BTAA Libraries wish to investigate an expansion in the scope of the Geoportal, the project will require additional expertise and higher level organizational leadership. This proposed Strategic Leadership Group should comprise 2-4 AUL or UL representatives, the UMN Project Lead, and two additional members of the Task Force. The Group will participate in the Year 3 Sustainability planning process, with a particular focus on: developing a Governance Group to provide oversight and decision making to the project in years 4 and beyond, and directing investigations into expansions of project scope. \n\n**Lead:** UMN Project Lead, in consultation with Project Sponsors\n\n#### 2. Archiving and preservation of at-risk data (Year 4)\n\nOne of the major potential expansions of scope is to add capacity to archive and preserve data sets, in addition to their metadata. This could encompass data created by researchers at participating BTAA institutions and/or establish archiving arrangements with external data producers, including local, regional and state government agencies. In addition to assessing the need for and desirability of such an expansion, the planning process will seek to understand both the technical and the administrative resources required. \n\n**Lead:** UMN Project Lead, in consultation with Project Sponsors\n\n#### 3. Expanded partner relationship with the network of geoportals across the country (Year 3 & Year 4)\n\nAs the BTAA Geospatial Data Project grows, the need to collaborate more directly with other academic geoportals across the country will increase. By expanding partner relationships, the project will be able to utilize this broader experience and expertise in order to better inform decision making, sustainability, and strategic planning. Expanded partner relationships may also lead to direct collaboration in the areas of archiving and preservation. \n\n**Lead:** UMN Project Lead, in consultation with Project Sponsors\n\n\n## Project Budget\n\n**Year 3 (July 2017 - June 2018) and Year 4 (July 2018 - June 2019)***\n\nNote: Detailed budget documents available upon request.\n\n### Budget Growth\n\nAs presented, the budget for Year 3 represents a no-growth option based on the 10 currently participating institutions. With additional participants, the project can expand support for metadata creation (UMN Graduate Assistants); expansion to additional institutions is assumed in the Year 4 budget. Expanded functional scope (preservation, licensed data, etc.) will likely require significant budget expansion; should planning indicate these expansions are desired, they will be included in a revised Year 4 budget proposal. \n\n### Additional Institutions\n\nIf additional institutions join the project for Year 3 (at a cost of $15,000 each), the additional funding will fund additional conference travel  (Collaboration, Promotion & Outreach), and personnel (additional graduate research assistants to work on metadata processing, which would benefit all institutions by both supplementing the variable capacity for participating institutions and providing for work on metadata for data sets that fall outside of scope for participating institutions), as well as software development needs, including development work on GeoBlacklight to implement interface changes recommended by user testing and in collaboration with the broader GeoBlacklight community.\n\n### In-Kind Contributions\n\nAside from the Metadata Coordinator,the UMN Spatial Data Analyst & Curator, and the Project Lead, the aggregate work done by Task Force Members across all participating institutions is equivalent to 1.8 FTE per year (Task Force Members report spending an average of eight hours per week per institution).\n\nThe project would also not be operational without the significant work of the Web Development Department at the University of Minnesota Libraries. \n\nThe project continues to direct the financial contributions towards enabling the collaboration by means of coordination and technology. Two years into the project, we continue to believe the funding investment catalyzes the aggregated staff investment.\n\nAdditional in-kind contributions during new activities, such as outreach to users, strategic planning, and service scope expansion, may be critical to the project’s long term success. A call for participation bringing requisite expertise in support of these activities will likely be made.\n\n\n### Appendix: Current Project Overview & Summary of Activities (July 2015 - January 2017)\n\nThe Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Data Discovery project supports the creation and aggregation of discovery-focused metadata describing geospatial data resources from participating institutions and makes those resources discoverable via the [Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org/). The project also provides the technology project staffing and infrastructure to host the services.\n\nThe project is a collaborative pilot project to provide discoverability, facilitate access, and connect researchers across the Big Ten Academic Alliance to geospatial data resources.

Others include \u003Ca href=\"http://data.opengeoportal.org/\">OpenGeoportal\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://earthworks.stanford.edu/\">Earthworks\u003C/a>, and \u003Ca href=\"https://geo.nyu.edu/\">NYU Spatial Data Repository\u003C/a>. As of January 2017, the BTAA project has contributed over 4,400 metadata records to \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/OpenGeoMetadata\">OpenGeoMetadata\u003C/a>, a large-scale aggregation of geospatial metadata from many different institutions (see a detailed current project summary in Appendix A). By participating in the broader geospatial metadata ecosystem, these records can now be utilized by other geoportals to allow discovery and access for geospatial data resources from eight states within the Big Ten Academic Alliance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As the project unfolds, a preservation dimension for these data is emerging. The BTAA Geospatial Data Task Force, as well as the broader GeoBlacklight community, see a need for archiving, preservation, and access for at-risk geospatial data resources. These born digital resources are not being systematically archived by the government agencies that produce the data, as their mission is to provide researchers, citizens, and other users with access to the most recent data. As government funding remains flat or declines, recent historical data are often at risk of being lost. Locally produced research data may have continuing research value, but data producers lack a scalable preservation solution. Developing a preservation solution for these data will require significant additional resources and, potentially, collaboration with a broader group of stakeholders, and is therefore a possible future strategic direction that will take time to explore.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"detailed-project-goals\">Detailed Project Goals\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#detailed-project-goals\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Detailed Project Goals”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Years 3 &#x26; 4 (July 2017 - June 2019)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Finalization of Year 4 goals is expected to be informed by findings and deliberations in Year 3 and will be presented to BTAA Library Directors in early 2018.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"1-sustainability\">1.

Group membership was finalized in December with the group’s first meeting occurring in January 2021.\n\nAn important motivator in charging the DCWG was a line in the collection development policy, in which it is noted that we “aspire to collect and provide access to geospatial resources that represent diverse perspectives, abilities, and experience levels.” We recognized that the degree to which we are meeting this aim or prioritizing diversity in our geoportal collection development decisions was not well known.\n\nAt its outset, the purpose of the DCWG was to:\n\n1. Identify a process for defining and assessing diversity in our current geoportal collections, and carry out that assessment\n2. Make recommendations for how diversity can be more purposefully considered in our future collection development\n\n\n## Group Membership\n\n* Jay Bowen (Iowa)\n* Danny Dotson (Ohio State)\n* Cathy Hodge (Iowa)\n* Melinda Kernik (Minnesota)\n* Theresa Quill (Indiana)\n* Josh Sadvari (lead; Ohio State)\n* Cecilia Smith (Chicago)\n\n\n## Process\n\nThe DCWG conducted nine virtual meetings between January - December 2021. In our early meetings, we brainstormed questions and ideas for the group to consider and their relation to our charge. A guiding question that influenced much of the rest of our work was “what makes a collection of maps and geospatial data diverse?”.\n\nItem characteristics that we identified as ways to represent or enhance the diversity of our geoportal collections and associated resources included:\n\n1. Coverage (spatial/temporal)\n2. Countries of origin\n3. Creator identities\n4. Languages\n5. Subject matter\n6. Content levels (e.g., for intended audience of educational resources)\n\nRather than undertake a sweeping assessment of all items available in the geoportal, DCWG members brainstormed and scoped short-term projects to explore one or more of these aspects (and possible connections to other project team and committee activities) in greater detail. We acknowledge that this approach limited our ability to fully meet the first purpose for the group as noted in the charge (i.e., to carry out a diversity assessment of current geoportal collections), but we also feel that it positioned us to better address the second and more forward-focused purpose of the group (i.e., to make recommendations for future collection development activities).\n\nThe following section includes brief summaries for each of these short-term projects, as well as some preliminary outcomes and possible next steps.\n\n\n## Project Summaries and Preliminary Outcomes\n\n\n### 1) Map Languages \n\n(Danny Dotson)\n\nBTAA Geospatial Information Network members from each participating institution shared information about the languages represented across our cataloged print map collections. Unsurprisingly, out of approximately 1.7 million maps in this sample, over 85% are in English. However, this project can help us to identify instances in which our institutions may hold distinctive content based on the relative rarity of maps in particular languages, as well as possible collection strengths where institutions hold a relatively high number of maps in a given language. Both of these cases are worth further examination as candidates for potential local or collective scanning projects.\n\nLanguage is one aspect of a diverse map collection that can be a starting point for approaching other intersecting aspects, such as spatial coverage or creator identities (i.e., a non-English language map created by an individual or organization local to the area of interest). It also opens up opportunities for local collaboration (e.g., with area studies colleagues to identify shared opportunities in support of research, teaching, and learning and associated map scanning priorities) and collective collaboration (e.g., shared prioritization for multi-institution scanning projects to increase discovery and access of distinctive non-English language maps).\n\nThere are relatively few non-English language maps in the geoportal currently (and these are not easily discoverable due to lack of language search/facet options), so map language provides one avenue to diversify our collections. For the most part, this will require participating institutions to make language a priority for future map scanning projects in ways that align with local collection development, research, and curricular interests. However, it also requires a critical reexamination and revision of our collection development policy, in which we specifically note an emphasis on English language content as a criterion in scoping the geoportal collection.\n\n \nPossible next steps stemming from this project include:\n\n* Ensuring that language metadata is present and accurate for geoportal records. We are excited that the Metadata Committee has already begun to act on this recommendation, including adding missing language values for 700+ datasets/maps during the December 2021 metadata sprint.\n* Ensuring that all maps in participating institutions’ catalogs contain language information. Outdated map language MARC codes should be updated.\n* Agreeing to a controlled vocabulary for language, such as the one used for MARC records.\n* Adding a new language facet to support refinement of geoportal search results based on this item characteristic.\n\n\n### 2) Geospatial Data Tags and Subjects\n\nISO topic categories have historically been used as a standardized vocabulary for creating subject search terms in the geoportal. While ISO topic categories are widely recognized as a thesaurus for geospatial information resources and allow for the creation of subject facets, user testing has shown that these terms are too general to be useful when searching geoportal content. The two projects discussed below are geared toward the idea of possibly using other vocabularies to support search functionality in the geoportal, especially for enhancing discoverability of content on equity and social justice related topics.\n\n\n#### a) Content and Format Review for Esri’s Racial Equity GIS Hub \n\n(Melinda Kernik and Cecilia Smith)\n\nEsri describes the [Racial Equity GIS Hub](https://gis-for-racialequity.hub.arcgis.com/) as “an ongoing, continuously expanding resource hub to assist organizations working to address racial inequities.” Resources on the Hub site are categorized as applications, data, and articles, and the primary audience appears to be local government and business leaders.\n\nData layers available through the Racial Equity GIS Hub are authored by Esri or “trusted partners” (e.g. CDC) but may derive from other sources, such as the Census Bureau, philanthropic organizations (e.g., Robert Wood Johnson Foundation), university research centers (e.g., University of Richmond Digital Scholarship Lab), news organizations (e.g., Washington Post), and more. Datasets are assigned into 10 different categories (Climate and Environmental, Criminal Justice, Economic, Education, Elections, Health, Housing, Language, Demographic, and Infrastructure). At the time of review, there were also approximately 200 unique tags associated with these datasets, with examples such as policy, race, at risk, income, vulnerable populations, air quality, food environment, segregation, social justice, and many more. In addition to datasets, the Racial Equity GIS Hub includes many examples of formats not currently included in the geoportal, such as web applications and story maps. In fact, there are nearly twice as many applications found in the Hub compared to datasets, originating from a much wider variety of sources.\n\nPotential next steps highlighted through this project include:\n\n* Using the Racial Equity GIS Hub’s categories and tags as a foundation, refine a tag list through user testing to make equity and social justice related content in the geoportal more discoverable and enhance usability of the subject facet. General tags or categories (e.g., “racial justice”) could also be used to draw attention to the existence of these data layers as a whole.\n* Most of the datasets provided through the Racial Equity for GIS Hub are relatively current and from sources that are national in scope. Efforts among project members to increase resources for racial equity and social justice can focus on data from non-census sources and local sources, as well as historical data. This recommendation is already being acted upon, with an emphasis on possible partnerships with local public libraries and historical societies in discussions and funding applications associated with the next phase of the BTAA Geospatial Information Network’s collective efforts.\n* Targeted use of web applications, story maps, and dashboards as part of future efforts of the Communications Committee and Education and Outreach group can help to highlight data in context, raising awareness of geoportal resources and their use in projects to advance racial equity and social justice. Examination of these resources for their original sources may also point us to types of organizations not currently emphasized in geoportal collection efforts from which we might harvest metadata.\n\n\n#### b) Content and Format Review for Current Data Providers \n\n(Josh Sadvari)\n\nThis project built on the work described above but with a focus on practices of current data providers in terms of their use of descriptive tags and creation of content in formats not currently harvested into the geoportal.\n\nThe starting point for analysis of descriptive tags was a spreadsheet of approximately 14,500 geoportal items harvested from 76 ArcGIS Hub sites. A keyword field was included, listing the descriptive tags for each item. Unique keywords and their frequencies were identified using the Document Terms tool provided by Voyant Tools. After removing all document terms with only one associated record, the dataset was reduced from 9,106 unique terms to 4,687. After additional filtering to remove information discoverable through other geoportal facets (e.g., formal geographic names, creator names, dates) and abbreviations or misspellings, the final sample of unique terms was 2,917. These terms were cross-checked against the list of tags associated with the Racial Equity GIS Hub, and possible alternate terms were identified as well. This process, albeit a subjective one, resulted in a list of approximately 630 terms (including the Racial GIS Equity Hub tags) with possible relevance to equity and social justice datasets. Examples of terms used by current providers that were not represented in the Racial Equity GIS Hub include accessibility, child care, culture, economic development, election map, health care, human trafficking, open space, opioid, police, public service, sustainability, water quality, and many more.\n\nIn addition, a sample of 18 current data provider sites representing state, county, and city administrative levels was reviewed for content being disseminated in formats such as web mapping applications, story maps, and dashboards. It was found that approximately 500 web mapping applications were being made available through these providers, but that very few seemed to be directly related to equity and social justice topics. It was also discovered on some ArcGIS Hub sites that web mapping applications were accessible via the main page but with no corresponding item record in the portal, which would pose a logistical hurdle to harvesting such content into the geoportal.\n\n\nPotential next steps highlighted through this project include:\n\n* Further analysis and refinement of the tag list generated from the current data provider spreadsheet to support user testing for identification of equity and social justice related datasets.\n* Based on results of user testing, consider developing a thesaurus of terms that could be used for various purposes including enhancing  the subject facet, grouping resources into thematic collections, metadata sprints (e.g., standardizing data provider tags to our preferred thesaurus), and direct outreach to data providers (e.g., encouraging use of these terms to enhance discoverability through the geoportal).\n* Forego prioritizing harvesting of web applications from current data providers, though select examples could be used as part of ongoing Communications Committee and Collection Development and Education Outreach Committee activities.\n\n### 3) Critical Cartography and Data Ethics Resources \n\n(Jay Bowen and Theresa Quill)\n\nCritical cartography is a way of engaging with maps that asserts that maps cannot be neutral, and that traditional cartography reflects and perpetuates power structures; typically reflecting the worldview and priorities of a dominant group. Best stated by [Crampton and Krygier (2005)](https://www.acme-journal.org/index.php/acme/article/view/723), “critical cartography assumes that maps _make_ reality as much as they represent it...Maps are active; they actively construct knowledge, they exercise power and they can be a powerful means of promoting social change.”\n\nCritical cartography asks creators and readers of maps to critically interrogate maps as they would any other source of information, including by examining potential biases of the creator and data. A goal of this project was to identify and create resources to help mapmakers and readers with this process, resources that could also assist in teaching and researching equity and social justice topics through geospatial data, maps, and mapmaking.\n\nEarly outcomes of this work include a [critical cartography reading list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lPI14I7YCqn7QczbimSg7NOQvxTOJezsNtNQC7suU4M/edit?usp=sharing) with resources to support both undergraduate and graduate research and curricular needs. Additionally, as the resources on this list were being explored, a draft ethics statement was prepared in the spirit of the [AAG Statement on Professional Ethics](http://www3.aag.org/cs/about_aag/governance/statement_of_professional_ethics), [URISA’s GIS Code of Ethics](https://www.urisa.org/about-us/gis-code-of-ethics/), and the many considerations posed by the authors of the collected readings:\n\nEthics for Establishing and Sustaining Social Justice and Equity through Geospatial Data and Mapping\n\n1. Promote geospatial data and analysis relevant to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.\n2. Address gaps in the availability of certain kinds of geospatial data which prevent efforts to study, analyze, understand, and ameliorate particular injustices.\n3. Share and prioritize free and open source geospatial data and technology with the aim of extending geospatial technologies and techniques to those missing or underrepresented in relevant professions and fields of study.\n4. Promote GIS and mapmaking practices that serve, represent, and include underrepresented groups, identities, and classes in the interests of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.\n5. Raise critical awareness of how maps, cartographic practices, and geospatial data can be used to threaten or serve underrepresented, vulnerable, or oppressed people, and encourage the critical interpretation and use of existing maps and geospatial data.\n\nPotential next steps stemming from this project include:\n\n* Creating shared lesson plans and other educational resources using the critical cartography reading list.\n* Examining course listings at our institutions for targeted promotion and collaboration with instructors.\n* Formalizing an ethical statement and integrating into other BTAA Geospatial Information Network activities as appropriate (e.g., updating language in our collection development policy related to diversity as a criterion for scoping the collection).\n\n\n## Working Group Deliverables\n\nA primary deliverable of this group is the documentation, preliminary outcomes, and associated recommendations stemming from the short-term projects described above. These materials can serve as a foundation for such projects to be continued and a focus on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) to be purposefully integrated throughout our practices, locally and collectively, related to the BTAA Geospatial Information Network. We acknowledge that we only scratched the surface of this topic and how it can inform our future work. We did not “fix” diverse collections but started conversations to move us in the right direction.\n\nThat is not to say that this work did not result in any concrete action. As noted above in the project summaries, the Metadata Committee has begun efforts to include enhancement of language metadata for maps and datasets into their sprint structure. Recommendations related to an increased focus on local and historical sources have been integrated into a diversity plan articulated in a recent IMLS preliminary proposal, and our discussions about possible partner institutions for the next phase of the project have broadened to include more types of community organizations, such as state and public libraries, archives, and historical societies. A critical cartography reading list and draft ethics statement have also resulted from our project work. As an example of how this work has also influenced local practices, two working group members (Dotson and Sadvari) have begun a collaboration with Ohio State’s Japanese Studies Librarian to review our collection of Japanese language maps to better understand their alignment with research and curricular interests and to propose a map scanning project accordingly. We hope this can serve as a model for other such collaborations and invite other project members to share their own local efforts to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility on an ongoing basis.\n\nAs the work of our group continued beyond the short-term projects described above, we brainstormed “radical” ideas (i.e., a significant departure from our current practices). Examples of such ideas included developing a process for community-driven collection development, a BTAA Geospatial Information Network student research fellowship to support projects addressing equity and social justice topics across our geographic region, embedding prompts related to relevant data literacy concepts at the point of discovery, and creating shared digital exhibits on topics with geographic relevance and/or deriving from our collections. All of these ideas would require project member buy-in and integration into existing committee practices to implement. We emphasize again the importance of starting these conversations as a deliverable of the DCWG, with the aim of integrating such work into our ongoing collective efforts.\n\nFinally, the work of the DCWG has led to engagement with our broader professional community in several ways:\n\n1. On October 27, the DCWG delivered a presentation titled [“Collections, Collaboration, and Crowdsourcing: The BTAA Geoportal’s Diverse Collections Working Group”](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16VtBgowa0T-XMMUTRz4aD22L1waXkN_FMV_lJkG_zjc/edit?usp=sharing) at the WAML virtual conference.\n2. On November 8, ongoing work of the DCWG was highlighted as part of the BTAA convening titled [“Community Action in Practice: Networks of Trust in BTAA Library Initiatives.”](https://btaa.zoom.us/rec/play/J8YYJ6tTybrHN1Cf144vzdqpp5uZ-02jl7u3p2AGB_Jw28DpqVGa3xgeKCfFV7ATvvnNTt5bUaUJvzw.UJfz1zyTAGF6qWKk?continueMode=true)\n3. Inspired by the work of the DCWG, two members (Quill and Sadvari) proposed and will be co-editors for a special issue of the _Journal of Map & Geography Libraries_ on the topic of “Practicing Map and Geospatial Information Librarianship through the Lens of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility” (anticipated publication in Fall 2022).\n\n\n## Moving Forward\n\nThough the DCWG was originally charged by the Collection Development Committee (now Collection Development and Education Outreach, CDEO), it should be clear from the information presented above that the work of supporting diverse collections and diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility more broadly touches all aspects of the BTAA Geospatial Information Network. As the DCWG continued to meet throughout 2021, we increasingly recognized this. Work that began with a fairly narrow scope expanded to include short-term projects, ideation, and professional engagement geared toward the idea that we must continually evaluate and evolve our policies, practices, and platform with an aim toward advancing DEIA through our local and collective efforts. \n\nWith that in mind, the main recommendation that we have arrived at as a group is that:\n\n**Beginning in 2022, BTAA Geospatial Information Network standing committees and future working groups should articulate at least one annual goal aimed at advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility through geoportal activities and content.**\n\nLogistically, the Steering Committee should provide support in creating and prioritizing these goals, identifying where this work intersects across multiple groups, sharing progress, overcoming challenges, and holding ourselves accountable.\n\nThere are a number of resources that we can look to in support of identifying, articulating, and accomplishing these goals:\n\n### Diverse Collections\n\n* The ALA document on [Diverse Collections: An Interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights](https://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/interpretations/diversecollections) lists six best practices that can inform our work:\n    * Selecting content in multiple formats\n    * Considering resources from self-published, independent, small, and local producers\n    * Seeking content created by and representative of marginalized and underrepresented groups\n    * Evaluating how diverse collection resources are cataloged, labeled, and displayed\n    * Including content in all of the languages used in the community that the library serves, when possible\n    * Providing resources in formats that meet the needs of users with disabilities\n\n        \n### Science & Technology Librarianship\n\n* [Science Librarianship and Social Justice](https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/istl/index.php/istl/section/view/social-justice)\n    * A recent series of columns in _Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship_ “aims to open a dialog around equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) concepts, definitions, and examples in both library and science contexts…”\n    * Many of these concepts are directly applicable (and the examples provided are analogous) to map and geospatial library work and can inform our approach to local and collective activities.\n        \n### General Resources\n\n* [ALA: Equity, Diversity, and

Unsurprisingly, out of approximately 1.7 million maps in this sample, over 85% are in English. However, this project can help us to identify instances in which our institutions may hold distinctive content based on the relative rarity of maps in particular languages, as well as possible collection strengths where institutions hold a relatively high number of maps in a given language. Both of these cases are worth further examination as candidates for potential local or collective scanning projects.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Language is one aspect of a diverse map collection that can be a starting point for approaching other intersecting aspects, such as spatial coverage or creator identities (i.e., a non-English language map created by an individual or organization local to the area of interest). It also opens up opportunities for local collaboration (e.g., with area studies colleagues to identify shared opportunities in support of research, teaching, and learning and associated map scanning priorities) and collective collaboration (e.g., shared prioritization for multi-institution scanning projects to increase discovery and access of distinctive non-English language maps).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There are relatively few non-English language maps in the geoportal currently (and these are not easily discoverable due to lack of language search/facet options), so map language provides one avenue to diversify our collections. For the most part, this will require participating institutions to make language a priority for future map scanning projects in ways that align with local collection development, research, and curricular interests. However, it also requires a critical reexamination and revision of our collection development policy, in which we specifically note an emphasis on English language content as a criterion in scoping the geoportal collection.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Possible next steps stemming from this project include:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Ensuring that language metadata is present and accurate for geoportal records.

Datasets are assigned into 10 different categories (Climate and Environmental, Criminal Justice, Economic, Education, Elections, Health, Housing, Language, Demographic, and Infrastructure). At the time of review, there were also approximately 200 unique tags associated with these datasets, with examples such as policy, race, at risk, income, vulnerable populations, air quality, food environment, segregation, social justice, and many more. In addition to datasets, the Racial Equity GIS Hub includes many examples of formats not currently included in the geoportal, such as web applications and story maps.

After additional filtering to remove information discoverable through other geoportal facets (e.g., formal geographic names, creator names, dates) and abbreviations or misspellings, the final sample of unique terms was 2,917. These terms were cross-checked against the list of tags associated with the Racial Equity GIS Hub, and possible alternate terms were identified as well. This process, albeit a subjective one, resulted in a list of approximately 630 terms (including the Racial GIS Equity Hub tags) with possible relevance to equity and social justice datasets.

These materials can serve as a foundation for such projects to be continued and a focus on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) to be purposefully integrated throughout our practices, locally and collectively, related to the BTAA Geospatial Information Network. We acknowledge that we only scratched the surface of this topic and how it can inform our future work. We did not “fix” diverse collections but started conversations to move us in the right direction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That is not to say that this work did not result in any concrete action. As noted above in the project summaries, the Metadata Committee has begun efforts to include enhancement of language metadata for maps and datasets into their sprint structure. Recommendations related to an increased focus on local and historical sources have been integrated into a diversity plan articulated in a recent IMLS preliminary proposal, and our discussions about possible partner institutions for the next phase of the project have broadened to include more types of community organizations, such as state and public libraries, archives, and historical societies. A critical cartography reading list and draft ethics statement have also resulted from our project work. As an example of how this work has also influenced local practices, two working group members (Dotson and Sadvari) have begun a collaboration with Ohio State’s Japanese Studies Librarian to review our collection of Japanese language maps to better understand their alignment with research and curricular interests and to propose a map scanning project accordingly. We hope this can serve as a model for other such collaborations and invite other project members to share their own local efforts to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility on an ongoing basis.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As the work of our group continued beyond the short-term projects described above, we brainstormed “radical” ideas (i.e., a significant departure from our current practices). Examples of such ideas included developing a process for community-driven collection development, a BTAA Geospatial Information Network student research fellowship to support projects addressing equity and social justice topics across our geographic region, embedding prompts related to relevant data literacy concepts at the point of discovery, and creating shared digital exhibits on topics with geographic relevance and/or deriving from our collections. All of these ideas would require project member buy-in and integration into existing committee practices to implement. We emphasize again the importance of starting these conversations as a deliverable of the DCWG, with the aim of integrating such work into our ongoing collective efforts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Finally, the work of the DCWG has led to engagement with our broader professional community in several ways:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>On October 27, the DCWG delivered a presentation titled \u003Ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16VtBgowa0T-XMMUTRz4aD22L1waXkN_FMV_lJkG_zjc/edit?usp=sharing\">“Collections, Collaboration, and Crowdsourcing: The BTAA Geoportal’s Diverse Collections Working Group”\u003C/a> at the WAML virtual conference.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>On November 8, ongoing work of the DCWG was highlighted as part of the BTAA convening titled \u003Ca href=\"https://btaa.zoom.us/rec/play/J8YYJ6tTybrHN1Cf144vzdqpp5uZ-02jl7u3p2AGB_Jw28DpqVGa3xgeKCfFV7ATvvnNTt5bUaUJvzw.UJfz1zyTAGF6qWKk?continueMode=true\">“Community Action in Practice: Networks of Trust in BTAA Library Initiatives.”\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Inspired by the work of the DCWG, two members (Quill and Sadvari) proposed and will be co-editors for a special issue of the \u003Cem>Journal of Map &#x26; Geography Libraries\u003C/em> on the topic of “Practicing Map and Geospatial Information Librarianship through the Lens of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility” (anticipated publication in Fall 2022).\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"moving-forward\">Moving Forward\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#moving-forward\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Moving Forward”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Though the DCWG was originally charged by the Collection Development Committee (now Collection Development and Education Outreach, CDEO), it should be clear from the information presented above that the work of supporting diverse collections and diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility more broadly touches all aspects of the BTAA Geospatial Information Network.

This phase focused on pilot collection development, metadata expansion, workflow refinement, and platform enhancements.\n\n### Outcomes\n\n* We curated a pilot collection of [35 datasets](https://geodev.btaa.org/?f%5Bpcdm_memberOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=btaa-074bc4ad-ed3d-4fe7-8339-562bc1109cb3) on our development site to test our processes for gathering, describing, and sharing geospatial information.  \n* We added new metadata fields and entry guidelines to provide technical and administrative documentation for datasets.  \n* We created new methods for programmatically generating metadata and derivative files from collected datasets.  \n* We introduced new ways for users to evaluate datasets with visual previews and data dictionaries.\n\n### Next Steps: The Foundation Phase (2025–2026)\n\n* **Partnerships:** We will partner with data providers to develop a process for exchanging resources.  \n* **Technology:** We will continue to enhance the BTAA Geoportal and backend management tools.  \n* **Collections:** We will curate real-world data submissions to build our first official collections.  \n* **Curation Plan:** We will release a formal plan that documents our goals, workflows, and guidelines.\n\n### Full Report Contents\n\n1. **Pilot Working Group Final Report:** Outlines the scope and major outcomes of our initial pilot, along with challenges encountered.  \n2. **New Developments:** Describes what changed in our metadata standards, data access features, and overall workflow.  \n3. **Pilot Collection Inventory:** Provides a list of the sample datasets curated for this phase, published on our development geoportal.  \n4. **Next Steps:** Recommends actions for the next phase based on what we learned during the pilot.  \n5. **Roadmap:** Presents our longer-term goals and milestones through 2027\\.\n\n## BTAA-GIN Geodata Pilot Workgroup Report\n\nThe BTAA-GIN Geodata Pilot Workgroup met from Q1 2024-Q1 2025 to develop preliminary recommendations for building a geodata collection. The workgroup laid the groundwork for a geodata collection program, focusing on technical infrastructure, metadata standards, and workflows.\n\n### Scope\n\nThe Workgroup prioritized technical and metadata development over policy discussions, such as data provider agreements, which were assigned to a future group.\n\nWe realized that collecting the data provided an opportunity to expand our metadata documentation. Instead of relying solely on discovery and descriptive metadata fields, we introduced fields for technical and administrative metadata. By examining and running scripts on the downloaded data, we documented elements such as file size, resolution, and projection. As part of a processing workflow, we further added information about the provenance of the dataset.\n\nThis proactive approach will allow us to document as much as possible at the outset, minimizing the need to revisit datasets for additional information later. While our metadata profile does not currently conform to established standards such as ISO 191xx, we established a framework that captures the majority of information such standards require. This positions us well for future crosswalking to internationally recognized standards.\n\n### Activities\n\n* Expanded and refined the metadata profile to support more detailed documentation.\n\n* Oversaw the implementation of asset storage and data ingest functionality into the technology stack.\n\n* Vetted Python scripts for automating metadata extraction, data processing, and technical validation.\n\n* Established a plan to use web-friendly data derivatives, such as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs), PM Tiles, and visual thumbnails to enhance accessibility.\n\n* Assembled a pilot collection of 35 curated items, showcasing diverse formats and the implementation of new metadata features. This collection will be used as a proof of concept when communicating with potential partners.\n\n* Developed a prototype model for documenting dataset fields and values in simple tables based on the “Entity and Attributes” section of the FGDC standard.\n\n### Challenges\n\n* Meeting user needs for metadata with the varying quality of documentation from data providers.\n\n* Applying single-layer archiving principles to multipart items, such as Geodatabases.\n\n* Addressing the verbosity of certain metadata fields, such as lineage or contact information, which are difficult to reformat into lightweight Solr fields as key:value pairs.\n\n* Providing data previews for static downloads in the absence of a dedicated geospatial web service platform, such as GeoServer or ArcGIS.\n\n* Ensuring users have access to data dictionaries. Although few standards exist for structuring this information and it is rarely included in geodata metadata, these details are essential for evaluating the dataset’s contents. Only the legacy FGDC metadata standard provides a structured place for data dictionaries.\n\n\n### Models and Tools\n\nWhenever possible, we built on existing models and tools to avoid reinventing the wheel, leveraging prior art to inform and streamline our work.\n\n* The BTAA Geoportal uses a local profile of OGM Aardvark metadata, which already provides a strong foundation for geospatial metadata. Following Aardvark’s established guidelines, we extended the profile with additional fields from DCAT and Dublin Core. In particular, we integrated elements from:  \n  * [DCAT-3 US Profile](https://doi-do.github.io/dcat-us/): A schema tailored for the United States, designed for interoperability.  \n  * [GeoDCAT](https://semiceu.github.io/GeoDCAT-AP/drafts/latest/): A geospatial adaptation of DCAT, incorporating several geospatial-specific fields.\n\n* Insights from Jaime Martindale’s work at UW-Madison’s Robinson Map Library provided valuable insights, including establishing minimum metadata requirements and best practices for engaging with data providers.\n\n* For metadata processing, we adapted scripts based on existing tools:  \n* [GeoDCT](https://github.com/mkernik/geodct) by Melinda Kernik: For creating file inventories and documenting fields.  \n* [Geospatial Metadata Toolkit](https://github.com/kimdurante/Geospatial-Metadata-Toolkit) by Kim Durante: For extracting technical metadata values.\n\n### Areas of Discussion and Decisions\n\n#### What datasets to include in the pilot collection\n\nThe workgroup considered what kind of data would be included in the pilot collection to be test and represent our goals. They scanned multiple data clearinghouses and portals and chose resources with a range across the following characteristics:\n\n* Geographic coverage: Maryland, New Jersey, Indiana, Illinois, and Minnesota  \n* Administrative levels: State, county, and municipal  \n* Temporal coverage: Current (2024) and historical (1970s, 2000s)  \n* Formats: Vector, raster, and databases  \n* Theme: Foundational layers (such as roads, parcels, and zoning) and high value layers (land cover/land use).\n\n\n#### What to use for a staging area\n\nA Box account was established as the primary staging area for data processing and temporary storage. While this solution provided an immediate workspace, discussions highlighted the need for a scalable and sustainable staging infrastructure to support long-term data management.\n\n#### How to approach geodata processing \n\nTo maintain data integrity, the workgroup decided to retain datasets in their original formats, avoiding reprojections or format conversions whenever possible. Additionally, new Python scripts were reviewed to facilitate the extraction of technical metadata, including file attributes, coordinate systems, and bounding box information, ensuring that essential metadata could be captured efficiently.\n\n#### What additional metadata to generate or collect\n\nMetadata discussions emphasized the importance of incorporating technical and administrative details, such as projections and data sources. Several new fields were proposed to enhance metadata completeness:\n\n* Provenance (`dct_provenanceStatement_sm`)  \n* Coordinate reference system (`dct_conformsTo_sm`)  \n* Spatial resolution (`dcat_spatialResolutionInMeters_s`)   \n* Scale (`geocat_spatialResolutionInText_sm`)  \n* Geographic extent (`b1g_dct_extent_sm`)\n\nThe group noted that numeric spatial resolution might only be useful for raster formats, as vector data often lacks standardized measurement criteria. For vector data, they approved a plain text field to hold scale descriptions. The group also explored strategies for organizing records into dataset series based on geographic coverage or temporal range, but did not recommend a formal solution.\n\n#### How to enhance GeoBlacklight (GBL) Admin\n\nThe workgroup evaluated improvements to GBL Admin that introduced new functionalities for uploading, attaching, and managing files through Amazon S3. They also identified elements to be included in a user download package, including the original dataset, metadata, and optional data dictionaries.\n\n#### How well the pilot collection represents our capabilities\n\nThe group conducted a final review of the pilot collection within the development geoportal to determine if it demonstrated our core capabilities. The workgroup assessed field structures and labels, making recommendations for refinements to improve clarity and usability. \n\n#### Next steps\n\nWith the pilot phase concluding, the workgroup recommended sunsetting its activities and transitioning to a new phase. The \"Foundations\" phase, set to begin in early 2025, will focus on collaborating with data providers to establish exchange workflows and build an initial collection. The new workgroup will explore potential partnerships with other institutions to expand and strengthen the collection.\n\n## Program Enhancements Overview\n\nWe have implemented several enhancements to our geodata management program to improve metadata quality, user experience, and operational efficiency. \n\n### 1. New Metadata Fields\n\nWe have introduced seven new metadata fields designed to capture spatial information, provenance, and more precise documentation. \n\n### 2. Updated Metadata Entry Guidelines\n\nTo accommodate the new metadata fields and improve overall consistency, we have augmented our Metadata Entry Guidelines. The revised guidelines offer instructions on populating the new fields and provide updated recommendations for existing fields, especially for internal assets. \n\n### 3. Derivatives\n\nTo enhance the user experience, we are now generating derivative files for our datasets\n\n* **Thumbnails** provide visual previews in search results, helping users quickly assess the relevance of a dataset.  \n* **PMTiles** offer web-friendly, single-file archives of tiled vector data, allowing integration into web maps without the need for complex geospatial servers.  \n* **Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs)** enable efficient streaming and visualization of raster data directly in web browsers, eliminating the need for specialized servers.\n\n### 4. Data Dictionaries\n\nTo improve resource interpretation, we have added data dictionaries as supplemental tables.  The dictionaries include field names, types, definitions, and definitions sources. The tables also support nested values.\n\n### 5. New Processing Recipes\n\nWe have developed several Python scripts to automate metadata extraction and data processing tasks. Key capabilities include:\n\n* Extracting technical metadata from various geospatial formats.  \n* Generating thumbnails and other derivative files.  \n* Creating PMTiles and COGs for web-friendly data access.  \n* Managing data dictionaries for improved metadata documentation.\n\n### 6. GBL Admin Enhancements\n\nTo support the expanded scope of our program, we have enhanced the GeoBlacklight (GBL) Admin tool. Originally designed for flat tables of metadata, GBL Admin now includes functionality to:\n\n* **Upload and Manage Assets**: Integrated with Amazon S3 for storage and management of files, including the ability to upload assets directly through the interface.  \n* **Centralize Distribution Links**: Consolidated all external and internal links into a unified Distributions table, improving organization and aligning our terminology better with metadata standards like ISO and DCAT.  \n* **Data Dictionaries**: Enabled the storage and management of data dictionaries within the relational database, allowing for dynamic updates and customized views.\n\n## New Metadata Fields\n\nWe added new fields to our metadata application profile for more thorough documentation. These fields bring us into closer alignment with existing metadata standards, including the ISO 191xx series and the DCAT-3 US Profile.\n\n### **New Spatial/Technical Fields**\n\n| Label | URI      | Description | Source/alignment | Example |\n| :---- | :-------- | :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **Conforms To** | `b1g_dct_conformsTo_sm` | The coordinate reference system expressed as a resolveable URI.   | This field is from Dublin Core.

This will help identify them and differentiate them from the ID of the original source record.\n\n* The **Subject** field is reserved for Library of Congress authority terms only.\n\n* The **Description** field no longer needs to have the scale, spatial resolution, or provenance concatenated, as special fields are now dedicated to that.\n\n* **Geometry** will reflect the outline of the dataset instead of a duplication of the bounding box\n\n* **Provenance Statement** should indicate when the resource was obtained and from where\n\n* **Publisher** (previously unused for datasets) will be the original distributor/provider\n\n* **Provider** will be Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Information Network (or BTAA-GIN during the pilot)\n\n* Internal assets should always have a value for the following fields: (unlike external assets, for which this information is optional or difficult-to-fill)\n     * **Resource Type**\n     * **Subject**\n     * **GeoNames**\n     * **File Size**\n\n     \n## Derivatives\n\nAs we expand our geodata collection and storage capabilities, creating derivative files has become an integral part of our workflow. Derivatives enhance the user experience by offering streamlined access and improved visualization of datasets. These files can be batch-generated using desktop scripts, making the process efficient and scalable. The following derivatives will be created:\n\n### 1. Thumbnail Images\n\n* Format: PNG or JPEG  \n* Purpose: Thumbnails provide a quick visual preview of a dataset, displayed directly on the search results page. These images help users assess the relevance of a dataset at a glance, improving discovery and usability.  \n* Although we have had thumbnail functionality available for scanned maps and some web services, we have generally not been able to provide them for external datasets.\n\n\n| ![](@images/pilot-search.png) |\n| :---: |\n| Search page providing thumbnail previews. |\n\n\n\n### 2. PMTiles\n\n#### What Are PMTiles?\n\nPMTiles is a single-file archive format designed for storing pyramids of tiled geospatial data. The format supports datasets addressed by Z/X/Y coordinates, including vector tiles, imagery, and remote sensing data. PMTiles archives can be hosted on platforms like Amazon S3, where they are accessed via HTTP range requests. This enables low-cost, zero-maintenance web mapping applications by minimizing the overhead of traditional web servers.\n\n#### Why Use PMTiles?\n\nPMTiles allows us to create web-friendly datasets that can be embedded into web maps without requiring users to download the data. Unlike traditional geospatial web servers like GeoServer or ArcGIS, PMTiles simplifies deployment and management.\n\n#### Current Limitations \n\nWhile GeoBlacklight can display PMTiles as overlays, features such as styled layers or querying datasets are not yet supported. These enhancements are part of GeoBlacklight’s future development roadmap.\n\n| ![](@images/pilot-pmtiles.png) |\n| ----- |\n| PM Tile showing an overlay visualization of the dataset. Maryland.

Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs)\n\n#### What Are COGs?\n\nA Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is an enhanced version of the standard GeoTIFF format. It is internally organized to optimize data access in cloud environments, leveraging features like tiling, overviews, and streaming capabilities. Clients can retrieve only the parts of a file they need using HTTP range requests, which improves performance and reduces bandwidth.\n\n#### Why Use COGs?\n\nCOGs serve the same purpose as PMTiles for raster datasets, enabling browser-based visualization without the need for a dedicated web server. They are ideal for high-resolution imagery and other large raster files.\n\n#### Key Features\n\n* Backward compatibility: All COG files are valid GeoTIFFs.  \n* Open standard: Developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the COG specification is free to use and implement.\n\n| ![](@images/pilot-cog.png) |\n| :---- |\n| Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF for a raster dataset Indiana.

(dataset) [https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa-0d1f5c0e-f93f-4889-be34-16104f9c6927](https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa-0d1f5c0e-f93f-4889-be34-16104f9c6927) |\n\n## Data Dictionaries\n\nThe Geodata Collection initiative has allowed us to address a long-standing concern: documenting data dictionaries. Often referred to as attribute table definitions or codebooks, data dictionaries describe a dataset's internal structure and provide information for understanding its contents.\n\nIn the past, our efforts have focused on descriptive metadata–titles, authors, dates, subjects, etc.–to help users find resources. We have devoted less attention to helping users evaluate resources. However, user feedback has consistently shown that data dictionaries are highly desired. Many users even assume this information is already included in metadata, leading to confusion when it is not readily available.\n\nThe challenge of documenting data dictionaries has persisted for years. The earlier geospatial metadata standard, FGDC, provided a structured format for this information through its Entities and Attributes section. However, the subsequent ISO 191xx standards replaced this section with ISO 19110, a standalone format for data dictionaries. Despite this shift, ISO 19110 files remain rare, likely because tools like ArcGIS do not export field definitions in this format. One exception is Stanford Libraries, which include ISO 19110 files in their dataset downloads. However, these files are not available as previews in their geoportal and are encoded in XML, making them difficult for users to read.\n\nAccessing data dictionaries is often a frustrating process for users, as the information is inconsistently stored across FGDC files, plain text files, or external websites. To address this, we have consolidated the information into a standardized table format. Users can now access data dictionaries directly from the item view page via a clearly labeled link—eliminating the need to search through XML files or external sources. \n\nOur data dictionary format is modeled on the FGDC standard. Using Python scripts, we extract field information from datasets or existing FGDC files and document it in simple CSV files. These CSVs are designed to accommodate nested entries by including a parent field identifier.\n\nWhile this approach has improved accessibility, many of our data dictionaries remain incomplete. In cases where field definitions are unavailable, we at least provide field names and types as extracted by our scripts. By storing this information in tables rather than static files, we retain the flexibility to update the dictionaries as new information becomes available. Even in their current state, these tables help users gain a clearer understanding of a dataset’s contents simply by browsing the field names.\n\n| ![](@images/pilot-dict1.png) | ![](@images/pilot-dict2.png) |\n| :---- | :---- |\n| Screenshot of Data Dictionary preview ([https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa-e4a8461e-6cd1-4c45-b6e8-5838bfe6bde3](https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa-e4a8461e-6cd1-4c45-b6e8-5838bfe6bde3)) | Screenshot of data dictionary with nested values.

These tools support the collection, documentation, and curation of geospatial datasets, aligning with geospatial metadata standards and improving user experience.\n\n### 1. Extract Technical Metadata\n\n* Modules Used: `geopandas`, `pandas`, `rasterio`, `shapely`  \n* Recipe: [Extract Technical Metadata](https://github.com/geobtaa/harvesting-guide/blob/main/recipes/R-16_extract/R-16_extract-geopandas.ipynb)\n\nThis script extracts spatial metadata from geospatial datasets stored in a directory and exports the results as a CSV file.\n\nSupported Geospatial Formats:\n\n* Vector: Shapefiles, GeoJSON  \n* Raster: GeoTIFF  \n* Geodatabases and Geopackages (records file name and size only)\n\nMetadata Extracted:\n\n* File folder and name  \n* File size (as Kb or Mb)  \n* Resource (geometry) type (i.e. “Point data”)  \n* Coordinate reference system (CRS) as a URI  \n* Bounding box (rectangular extent)  \n* Geometry shape as WKT outline  \n* Area (square kilometers, calculated from bounding box)  \n* Spatial resolution (meters, for raster datasets)\n\nAdditionally, for shapefiles and GeoJSONs:\n\n* Extracts attribute field information, generating a CSV file for each dataset with:  \n  * Field label  \n  * Field type  \n  * Values  \n  * Field definition  \n  * Definition source\n\n---\n\n### 2. Generate Derivative Files\n\n#### 2.1 Generate Thumbnails\n\n* Modules Used: `geopandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `rasterio`  \n* Recipe: [Thumbnail Generator](https://github.com/geobtaa/harvesting-guide/blob/main/recipes/R-16_extract/Get%20Thumbnail.ipynb)\n\nThis script generates thumbnail images for geospatial datasets. It processes files (Shapefiles, GeoJSONs, or GeoTIFFs) in a folder and outputs configurable images (width, height, and DPI).\n\n#### 2.2 Create PMTiles\n\n* Modules Used: `GDAL`  \n* Recipe: [PMTiles Generator](https://github.com/geobtaa/harvesting-guide/blob/main/recipes/R-16_extract/create_pm-tiles.ipynb)\n\nThis script creates PMTiles for vector datasets, with an intermediate step to reproject to EPSG:4326 (required for web visualization). The minimum and maximum zoom levels are configurable.\n\n#### 2.3 Create Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs)\n\n* Modules Used: `GDAL`  \n* Recipe: [COG Generator](https://github.com/geobtaa/harvesting-guide/blob/main/recipes/R-16_extract/create_COGs.ipynb) and [Create COG with 3 Bands](https://github.com/geobtaa/harvesting-guide/blob/main/recipes/R-16_extract/Create_COG-3Band.ipynb)\n\nThis script processes GeoTIFFs, reprojects them to EPSG:3857, and outputs Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs), optimized for web browser compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Helper Scripts\n\nTo ensure data consistency and compatibility, these scripts address common preprocessing needs.\n\n#### 3.1 Add Projection Files\n\n* Recipe: [Add Projection Script](https://github.com/geobtaa/harvesting-guide/blob/main/recipes/R-16_extract/Add%20projection.ipynb)\n\nThis script inserts `.prj` (projection) files into shapefiles within a directory. The projection must be defined in the script and is essential for extracting CRS, bounding box, geometry, area, and spatial resolution values.\n\n#### 3.2 Attribute Table Definitions\n\n* Recipe: [Extract Attribute Definitions](https://github.com/geobtaa/harvesting-guide/blob/main/recipes/R-16_extract/Add%20projection.ipynb)\n\nThis script parses FGDC metadata fields to extract attribute labels, definitions, and sources into a CSV. These results can optionally merge with tables generated by the Extract Technical Metadata script.\n\n## GeoBlacklight (GBL) Admin Enhancements\n\nTo support the collection, storage, and management of geodata, we enhanced the GeoBlacklight (GBL) Admin tool. Originally designed for metadata workflows, GBL Admin now includes functionality to upload and manage assets, centralize access links, and document data dictionaries. These improvements address the expanded needs of our program and align with best practices for geospatial data management.\n\nThe enhancements fall into three key areas:\n\n| Asset Upload and Management | Integration with Amazon S3 enables storage and management of assets, including uploads, file-level documentation, and thumbnail harvesting. |\n| :---- | :---- |\n| **Dedicated Distribution Table for Links** | A new “Distributions” table consolidates all external and internal links. This improves organization and provides administrative fields for custom labels. |\n| **Data Dictionaries** | A new table for data dictionaries provides users with immediate access to attribute table definitions. It also allows administrators to dynamically update the field-level metadata instead of relying upon static documents. |\n\n### 1\\. Asset Upload and Management\n\nTo enable asset management, we implemented a new workflow for uploading, attaching, and managing files. Key enhancements include:\n\n* **Amazon S3 Integration**  \n  * Established a new Amazon S3 storage account for secure and scalable storage.  \n  * Connected GBL Admin to the S3 bucket, supporting uploads of datasets and supplemental metadata.  \n  * Migrated existing thumbnails from web server storage to Amazon S3.  \n* **File Management and Background Processing**  \n  * Developed an initial `AssetsController` with accompanying views to manage file assets in S3.  \n  * Updated the file upload interface to:  \n    1. Allow identification of each file's associated reference type (`dct_references_s`).  \n    2. Enable uploads without a corresponding document, with assignment possible at a later time.  \n  * Implemented a batch process to harvest thumbnails from remote sources into S3.  \n  * Introduced a lower priority tier for background jobs to maintain application performance.\n\n#### **How It Works**\n\n1. From an item page, click **“Additional Assets”** to view attached assets.  \n2. Click the **“Upload Assets”** button.  \n3. Upload a file from your desktop and attach it to the record.  \n4. Select one of the following reference types:  \n   * Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)  \n   * Data dictionary/documentation  \n   * Download  \n   * Image file  \n   * Metadata in FGDC, HTML, ISO 19139, or MODS  \n   * OpenIndexMap  \n   * PMTiles  \n5. The uploaded asset is stored in S3, and its link is added to the `dct_references_s` field in Geoportal metadata.\n\n### 2\\. Dedicated Distribution Table for Links\n\nTo streamline the management of access links (referred to as \"References\" in GeoBlacklight), we created a dedicated **Distributions** table. This unified approach replaces scattered interface views across:\n\n* Main record views for external links.  \n* A secondary table for \"Multiple Downloads.\"  \n* The new assets panel for uploading and attaching files.\n\n#### **Benefits**\n\n* **Alignment with Standards**: Renaming this part of the metadata as “Distributions” aligns with terminology in the ISO metadata standard as well as the DCAT profile.  \n* **Improved Import/Export**:  \n  * Links are now stored separately, facilitating batch updates to descriptive metadata without affecting links.  \n  * Simplified CSV imports/exports, with smaller metadata files and the ability to handle arrays and multiple values for more fields.\n\n#### **How It Works**\n\n#### Option 1: Manual Entry\n\n1. From the item page, click **“Distributions.”**  \n2. Navigate to the **External – Document Distributions** section.  \n3. Enter the reference type and URL.  \n4. Click **“Create Download URL.”**\n\n#### Option 2: Batch Upload\n\n1. Prepare a CSV with the following columns:  \n   * `friendlier_id`: ID of the main record.  \n   * `reference_type`: One of the reference codes (see table below).  \n   * `distribution_url`: The asset’s URL.  \n   * `label` (optional): Custom label for the Download button.  \n2. From the item page, click **“Distributions.”**  \n3. Select **“Upload a CSV”** and upload your file.\n\n#### **Reference codes**\n\n* `arcgis_dynamic_map_layer`: ArcGIS DynamicMapLayer  \n* `arcgis_feature_layer`: ArcGIS FeatureLayer  \n* `arcgis_image_map_layer`: ArcGIS ImageMapLayer  \n* `arcgis_tiled_map_layer`: ArcGIS TiledMapLayer  \n* `cog`: COG  \n* `documentation_download`: Data dictionary / documentation download  \n* `documentation_external`: Full layer description  \n* `download`: Direct download file  \n* `iiif_image`: IIIF Image API  \n* `iiif_manifest`: IIIF Manifest  \n* `image`: Image file  \n* `metadata_fgdc`: Metadata in FGDC  \n* `metadata_html`: Metadata in HTML  \n* `metadata_iso`: Metadata in ISO 19139  \n* `metadata_mods`: Metadata in MODS  \n* `oembed`: oEmbed  \n* `open_index_map`: OpenIndexMap  \n* `pmtiles`: PMTiles  \n* `thumbnail`: Thumbnail file  \n* `tile_json`: TileJSON  \n* `tile_map_service`: Tile Map Service  \n* `wcs`: Web Coverage Service (WCS)  \n* `wfs`: Web Feature Service (WFS)  \n* `wmts`: WMTS  \n* `wms`: Web Mapping Service (WMS)  \n* `xyz_tiles`: XYZ Tiles\n\n### 3\\. Data Dictionaries\n\nData dictionaries are essential for documenting field names, types, and values. Previously, these were only stored as static files (e.g., XML, CSV). With the enhancements to GBL Admin, data dictionaries can now be managed in a relational database, offering flexibility and improved displays.\n\n#### Benefits\n\n* **Editable and Dynamic**: Data dictionaries can be updated in the database as new information becomes available.  \n* **Enhanced Presentation**: Information can be displayed dynamically on item pages.  \n* **Export Options**: Users can export the data dictionary in a structured format.\n\n#### How It Works\n\n1. Prepare a CSV with the following headers:  \n   * `friendlier_id`: ID of the parent record.  \n   * `label`: Field label.  \n   * `type`: Field type.  \n   * `values`: Sample or defined values.  \n   * `definition`: Field definition.  \n   * `definition_source`: Source of the definition.  \n   * `parent_field`: The parent field's name  \n2. From the item page, click **“Data Dictionary.”**  \n3. Provide a title and optionally a description of the data dictionary.  \n4. Select **“Upload a CSV”** and upload your file.\n\nOnce the data dictionary has been created, administrators can add, edit, or delete the fields.\n\n## Workflow Steps for Processing Metadata and Derivatives\n\nThis is an initial framework for the steps needed to process datasets for inclusion in the collection.\n\n1\\. Metadata harvest: Use the [BTAA-GIN Harvesting Guide recipes](https://github.com/geobtaa/harvesting-guide/tree/main/recipes) to parse metadata from APIs, individual files, and HTML sites.\n\n2\\. Download data: Download datasets manually or with a batch download tool like [WGET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget)\n\n3\\. Extract technical metadata: Use the new [extraction scripts](https://github.com/geobtaa/harvesting-guide/tree/main/recipes/R-16_extract) for spatial and technical metadata\n\n4\\. Merge metadata: Merge the metadata output from step 1 and step 3\\. Review and clean the values as needed.\n\n5\\. Generate derivatives: Use the new [generator scripts](https://github.com/geobtaa/harvesting-guide/tree/main/recipes/R-16_extract) to create thumbnails, PMTiles, and/or COGs\n\n6\\. Upload packages: Upload the metadata, datasets, and derivatives to GBL Admin.\n\n## Pilot Collection Inventory\n\nLink to full collection: [https://geodev.btaa.org/?f%5Bpcdm\\_memberOf\\_sm%5D%5B%5D=btaa-074bc4ad-ed3d-4fe7-8339-562bc1109cb3](https://geodev.btaa.org/?f%5Bpcdm_memberOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=btaa-074bc4ad-ed3d-4fe7-8339-562bc1109cb3)\n\n### Table 1: Standalone items\n\n| Title | Purpose | Format | PM Tiles | COG | Thumbnail | Data Dict | Code- book | Original Supplemental metadata |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- | ----- | ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: | ----- |\n| [Amtrak Station Locations \\[Indiana\\] {2000}](https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa-e4a8461e-6cd1-4c45-b6e8-5838bfe6bde3) | Point data example | Shapefile | x |  | x | x (extract from FGDC) |  | FGDC as HTML |\n| [Aquifer sensitivity in shallow aquifers \\[Indiana\\] {2015}](https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa-0d1f5c0e-f93f-4889-be34-16104f9c6927) | Raster data example | GeoTIFF |  | x | x | x  | nested in data dict. | FGDC as HTML |\n| [County Boundaries \\[Indiana\\] {2002}](https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa-6b8461b9-040c-4a7c-b09b-fde0c886c7f2) | Polygon data example with scale info | Shapefile | x |  | x | x (extract from FGDC) |  | FGDC as HTML |\n| [Dams \\[Nebraska\\]](https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa_06028e0343764fcb9370dc5a4bf53dc7) | Point data from an ArcGIS Hub with generated ISO metadata | Shapefile | x |  | x | x no definitions |  | ISO as HTML |\n| [Forest Inventory \\[Minnesota--Itasca County\\] {2025}](https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa_a42e393b-287e-401c-9c16-64e36dbd6ff5) | Geodatabase example | Geodatabase | x |  | x |  | part of FGDC | FGDC as XML and HTML |\n\n### Table 2: Related items\n\n| Title | Purpose | Format | PM Tiles | COG | Thumbnail | Data Dict | Code- book | Original Supplemental metadata |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---: | ----- | :---: | ----- | ----- | :---- |\n| [Roadway Network \\[New Jersey\\] {2023}](https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa-0455acb7-7784-4e05-a381-3fc41ec20baf) | Line data; recent version of high priority transportation layer | Shapefile | x |  | x |  |  |  |\n| [Roadway Network \\[New Jersey\\] {June 2024}](https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa-be6ed641-1e9a-4d4d-932e-97637df152b2) | Line data; Current version of high priority transportation layer | Shapefile | x |  | x |  |  |  |\n| [Zoning \\[Minnesota--Olmsted County\\] {2024}](https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa_5c94615c-6d9d-478f-bfb3-5bf2df834783) | County dataset with thumbnail.

This stage marks a transition from internal experimentation to external collaboration and public-facing operations. We will focus on four key areas: partnerships, collections, technology, and the publication of our first formal Curation Plan.\n\n### 1. Partnerships\n\nThe primary goal for this phase is to collaborate with at least two data providers to establish a sustainable workflow for dataset exchange and curation. These partnerships may inform the creation of sharing agreements that ensure clear expectations and communication. By working directly with data providers, we will also gain practical insights into their needs, which will help us refine our metadata guidelines, data ingestion workflows, and curation strategies.\n\n### 2. Technology\n\nWe will continue to iteratively improve our technology. On the front end, this will include BTAA Geoportal enhancements to item view pages. On the backend, we will implement batch ingest functionality.\n\n### 3. Collections\n\nIn collaboration with our data provider partners, we curate our first public-facing collections.\n\n### 4. Curation Plan\n\nThe Foundation Phase will result in the development and publication of Version 1 of the Curation Plan. This document will outline the collection’s scope, metadata framework, and workflows, serving as a reference for both internal and external stakeholders.\n\n## Geodata Collection Roadmap\n\nThe Geodata Collection Roadmap includes five overlapping phases. \n\n### Phase 1: Blueprints (2015–2023)\n\n* Conduct geodata archiving research.  \n* Publish scholarly articles and proposals.  \n* Environmental scan by the BTAA-GIN Geodata Archive Working Group.  \n* Approval of the BTAA-GIN Geodata Collection Strategic Plan.\n\n### Phase 2: Groundwork (2024–2025)\n\n#### 2A.

Often referred to as attribute table definitions or codebooks, data dictionaries describe a dataset’s internal structure and provide information for understanding its contents.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the past, our efforts have focused on descriptive metadata–titles, authors, dates, subjects, etc.–to help users find resources. We have devoted less attention to helping users evaluate resources. However, user feedback has consistently shown that data dictionaries are highly desired. Many users even assume this information is already included in metadata, leading to confusion when it is not readily available.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The challenge of documenting data dictionaries has persisted for years. The earlier geospatial metadata standard, FGDC, provided a structured format for this information through its Entities and Attributes section. However, the subsequent ISO 191xx standards replaced this section with ISO 19110, a standalone format for data dictionaries. Despite this shift, ISO 19110 files remain rare, likely because tools like ArcGIS do not export field definitions in this format. One exception is Stanford Libraries, which include ISO 19110 files in their dataset downloads. However, these files are not available as previews in their geoportal and are encoded in XML, making them difficult for users to read.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Accessing data dictionaries is often a frustrating process for users, as the information is inconsistently stored across FGDC files, plain text files, or external websites. To address this, we have consolidated the information into a standardized table format. Users can now access data dictionaries directly from the item view page via a clearly labeled link—eliminating the need to search through XML files or external sources.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Our data dictionary format is modeled on the FGDC standard. Using Python scripts, we extract field information from datasets or existing FGDC files and document it in simple CSV files. These CSVs are designed to accommodate nested entries by including a parent field identifier.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While this approach has improved accessibility, many of our data dictionaries remain incomplete. In cases where field definitions are unavailable, we at least provide field names and types as extracted by our scripts. By storing this information in tables rather than static files, we retain the flexibility to update the dictionaries as new information becomes available. Even in their current state, these tables help users gain a clearer understanding of a dataset’s contents simply by browsing the field names.\u003C/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003Ctable>\u003Cthead>\u003Ctr>\u003Cth align=\"left\">\u003Cstarlight-image-zoom-zoomable>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;@images/pilot-dict1.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003Cbutton aria-label=\"Zoom image\" class=\"starlight-image-zoom-control\">\u003Csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"currentColor\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cuse href=\"#starlight-image-zoom-icon-zoom\">\u003C/use>\u003C/svg>\u003C/button>\u003C/starlight-image-zoom-zoomable>\u003C/th>\u003Cth align=\"left\">\u003Cstarlight-image-zoom-zoomable>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;@images/pilot-dict2.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003Cbutton aria-label=\"Zoom image\" class=\"starlight-image-zoom-control\">\u003Csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"currentColor\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cuse href=\"#starlight-image-zoom-icon-zoom\">\u003C/use>\u003C/svg>\u003C/button>\u003C/starlight-image-zoom-zoomable>\u003C/th>\u003C/tr>\u003C/thead>\u003Ctbody>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd align=\"left\">Screenshot of Data Dictionary preview (\u003Ca href=\"https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa-e4a8461e-6cd1-4c45-b6e8-5838bfe6bde3\">https://geodev.btaa.org/catalog/btaa-e4a8461e-6cd1-4c45-b6e8-5838bfe6bde3\u003C/a>)\u003C/td>\u003Ctd align=\"left\">Screenshot of data dictionary with nested values.

SUMMARY\nThis document describes the BTAA-GIN Geodata Collection Strategic Plan for 2024-2026, including an overview of the expanded scope and the technology building blocks needed to meet this vision. \n\n\"Key Takeaways\"\n\n* New Scope: evolving from exclusively a metadata catalog to include selective geodata curation with operational cloud storage.\n* Increased Staff: a new full-time Program and Outreach Coordinator, an increase in hours for our Lead Developer, and consultation sessions with a Cloud Solutions Architect.\n* Budget: no budget increase will be needed for at least two years as we spend down strategic reserves, but a one-time increase of $138,000 (51%) will be needed in FY27, followed by yearly inflationary increases. See Budget section for details.\n\n\t\n### Timeline Overview\n\n\n\n-\t2024\n\t\n\t* Hire new staff\n\t* Develop curation plan\n\t* Run technology pilot\n\n-\t2025\n\t\n\t* Begin conducting active geodata curation\n\t* Share documentation and perform outreach\n\t* Assess & review\n\n\n-\t2026\n\t\n\t* Explore archiving & preservation strategies\n\n\n### Incremental steps to building a BTAA-GIN Geodata Collection\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  ![Incremental Steps](@images/incremental-steps.png){ loading=lazy}\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\n1. Metadata Curation: Collection and normalization of metadata.\n1. Discovery Portal: A geoportal for user-friendly discovery and access.\n1. Admin Toolkit: A workflow tool for ingesting, editing, and publishing assets.\n1. Data Curation: Evaluation, collection, and processing of geodata.\n1. Object Storage: A designated location for file storage and access.\n1. Preservation:  Long term storage in a repository system.\n\n## 2. JUSTIFICATION\n\n### 2.1 Background\n\nThe Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Information Network launched the BTAA Geoportal in 2016 with a mission confined to curating and storing metadata, excluding the handling of actual data objects. In the intervening years, we have cataloged nearly 70,000 records for geospatial resources and improved their discoverability through metadata normalization and centralization. \n\n### 2.2 The Need for Scope Expansion\n\nTo continue to serve the BTAA research community effectively, we have concluded that we must also systematically capture geodata.\n\n#### 2.2.1 Addressing the User Experience\nOver time, we have encountered a recurring challenge: many providers update, migrate, or delete their datasets without preserving prior versions. Consequently, our Geoportal, which relies on external links, faces the vexing issue of \"link rot.\" This undermines both user experience and the community's trust in our service.  Broken links deter users from revisiting the site and saving records for future use. By storing dataset versions over time, we can offer a consistent and reliable service to our users.\n\n#### 2.1.2 Filling the Temporal Gap\n\nAcademic libraries have well-established programs to collect and archive physical map collections. However, most libraries are collecting far fewer maps in recent years because government agencies now issue geospatial information as digital data instead of as maps. Unfortunately, many libraries have not yet updated their collection policies to include publicly available digital data. As a result, they are currently failing to capture the changing geospatial landscape for future researchers. Libraries must begin curating digital geodata to fill in the growing temporal gaps in their collections.\t\n\n\n### 2.2 Anticipated Outcomes\n\n#### 2.2.1 A collection that will grow in value over time\n\nWhen geospatial data is newly created, it holds high value due to its immediate relevance. As time passes, this data can seem less valuable as it becomes outdated or superseded by more current versions. However, its value can significantly increase later on as it gains historical significance. This can be illustrated by a U-shaped value curve, which shows an item's high initial worth, a decrease in value as it ages, and a subsequent increase as it becomes historical. We will be making investments in our future value by collecting geodata now.\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  ![u-shaped curve](@images/len-curve.jpg){ width=\"300\" loading=lazy}\n  \u003Cfigcaption>U-Shaped value curve illustrating increasing value over time\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\n\n#### 2.2.2 A significant contribution to the BIG Collection Initiative\n\nThe [BIG Collection Initiative](https://btaa.org/library/big-collection/the-big-collection-introduction) aims to create a cohesive network environment that provides universal content availability, enhances resource discovery, and ensures frictionless access. The initiative also prioritizes the long-term sustainability of both print and digital collections through coordinated preservation and digitization efforts. Our plan to curate geospatial data aligns with the B1G Collection Initiative, leveraging the collective strengths of BTAA libraries.\n\n## 3. Overview of Scope Expansion\n\n### 3.1 Collection Policy\n\nOur current collection policy covers metadata records for geodata and historical scanned maps. Our expanded policy will include a curated collection of public geodata, selectively chosen with the BTAA researchers in mind.\n\n**Geoportal Collections**\n\n| Collection                                                                                             | Hosting location                                                                                | Status  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n|  Collection A: Data Registry Public and licensed geodata.                                              | External data portals  (state & local governments, research institutes, vendors, and libraries) | Active  |\n| Collection B: Library Repositories Scanned maps and curated geodata.                                   | BTAA digital libraries                                                                          | Active  |\n|  Collection C: BTAA-GIN Geodata Foundational free and open public geodata layers from the recent past. | BTAA-GIN Amazon cloud storage                                                                   | Planned |\n\n\n### 3.2 Geodata Lifecycle\nUnder our current scope, we are only able to provide external links to the most recent versions of any dataset. When authors overwrite a public dataset, we must re-harvest the metadata and discard the previous version with its broken access links. Under our expanded scope, we will save versions of geodata before they are overwritten.  Users will still be able to access current versions from the original data provider, but will also be able to download historical versions.\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  ![u-shaped curve](@images/lifecycle-1.png){ width=\"600\" loading=lazy}\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Geodata Lifecycle in the BTAA-GIN ecosystem (Current operations)\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  ![u-shaped curve](@images/lifecycle-2.png){ width=\"600\" loading=lazy}\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Geodata Lifecycle in the BTAA-GIN ecosystem (Expanded operations)\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### 3.3 Staffing Plan\n\n#### 3.3.1 Leadership Team\n\n* Program Lead: Continues to lead strategic planning and coordination.\n* Geospatial Product Manager: Remains in charge of technical management and adds data curation to portfolio. Other program current responsibilities shift to new hire (see below).\n* Program and Outreach Coordinator (New): Manages community outreach and engagement, program coordination, and team management.\n\n#### 3.3.2 Development and Technical Implementation\n\n* Lead Developer (Current, Part-time, Contracted): Role expands from one week to two weeks per month to focus on BTAA Geoportal and Admin Toolkit software applications.\n* Cloud Solutions Consultant(s) (New, Temporary, Consultant): Collaborates with the Lead Developer and the University of Minnesota IT team to establish and optimize an Amazon Cloud-based storage infrastructure. This expertise may also be found in-house at one of the partner institutions.\n\n#### 3.3.3 Metadata and Data Curation\n\n* Graduate Research Assistant (Current): Role may shift to focus more on processing data, under the direction of the Geospatial Product Coordinator.\n* Program Team: Advises leadership team on identifying content, developing workflows, and maintaining communication with data providers.\n\n## 4. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS\n\n### 4.1 Emerging technologies\n\nOnce we have transitioned to cloud object storage, we will be well-positioned to harness emerging technologies that improve user experience. Many of these innovations originate within BTAA institutions, making them prime candidates for collaborative implementation. For instance, the University of Minnesota's groundbreaking Machines Reading Maps project offers a novel possibility: it can transform text from historical maps into searchable geocoded data. Similarly, we could adopt Northwestern University's Serverless IIIF, an AWS serverless application that enables image views.\n\n### 4.2 Preservation\n\nWhile the long-term preservation of collected datasets is outside the framework of our immediate plans, it is an essential component that merits future evaluation. In the future, we will likely need to develop workflows that include duplicating datasets to more permanent storage locations, verification and validation to maintain data integrity, and migration processes to adapt to evolving technologies and formats.","src/content/docs/library/geodata-collection-strategic-plan.md","d6b9ffe788cfaf12",{"html":1866,"metadata":1867},"\u003Cp>Prepared for:\nBig Ten Academic Alliance  Library Directors\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Prepared by:\nBig Ten Academic Alliance  Geospatial Information Network\nGeodata Collection Working Group\nOctober 2023\nRevised February 2024\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"1-summary\">1.

This vision began to take shape in 2012 when three map librarians issued a white paper, _A Collaborative Vision for Spatial Scholarship across the CIC_ (1). This paper identified geospatial data as a long-term, interdisciplinary need that would necessitate increasingly complex infrastructures to manage. The authors concluded that these infrastructures would likely be prohibitively expensive for each CIC library to maintain individually, and they proposed collaborative solutions for the long-term management of geospatial resources. \n{ .annotate }\n\n1.  Bidney, M., Mattke, R. & Weessies, K. (2012). A Collaborative Vision for Spatial Scholarship across the CIC, 2012, white paper. http://hdl.handle.net/11299/213250\n\nThis paper was a major impetus for the creation of the BTAA Geospatial Data Project, with its goal to provide discoverability, facilitate access, and connect scholars to geospatial data resources. The initial pilot project was to deliver a proof of concept with outcomes that included: a production-level online interface to geospatial data resources, a foundational geospatial metadata standard that would be interoperable and useful into the future, and a set of workflows for collaboratively creating metadata. \n\nThe project has since accomplished several of the recommendations laid out in the original white paper, including creating a collective specialized tool for discovering geospatial resources, combining scanned map collections, and encouraging active communication across the BTAA geospatial community. Along the way, it has also become a leader in the larger geospatial community.\n\nThe reasons behind the success of the project and its impact are delivered in this report.\n\n\nMatrix of BTAA Geospatial Data Project Impacts\n\n![Impact Matrix](@images//impact-matrix.png)\n\n## Impact #1: Participating institutions are now part of a spatial data infrastructure\n\n### What was the need?\n\nA spatial data infrastructure is  “a framework of technologies, policies, standards, and human resources necessary to acquire, process, store, distribute, and improve the use of geospatial data across multiple public and private organizations” (1). The benefits of a shared infrastructure include reduced costs through shared technology, consistency of data manipulation and output through agreed-upon standards, and improved data discovery and accessibility. \n{ .annotate }\n\n1. Wade, T., & Sommer, S. (2006). A to Z GIS, An illustrated dictionary of geographic information systems. Esri Press.\n\n\nPrior to this project, most BTAA libraries had not been able to provide a spatial data infrastructure to serve their users because they do not have the needed combination of funding, technology resources, and/or local expertise.\n\n\n### What did we do?\n\nWe began our collaboration in 2015 with two strategies: basing operations at the University of Minnesota and collecting financial contributions from each participating institution. This allowed us to hire a full-time Metadata Coordinator, fund a Spatial Data Analyst and Curator part-time, and utilize in-kind labor and funds from the University of Minnesota Libraries to contract with an application developer. \n\nOnce funding and staff were in place, we further built our collective spatial data infrastructure by: \n\n1. identifying important public geospatial resources\n2. agreeing upon a metadata standard and developing a processing workflow\n3. releasing a collective geoportal\n4. publishing metadata records and keeping them updated\n5. performing outreach to users on how to find and access resources in the site\n6. documenting our research and guidelines\n7. establishing governance for the growth and sustainability of the project\n\n\n### What were the outcomes?\n\n#### A public-facing search portal \n\nBy collectively funding this project and centralizing its operation, each institution can reference a geoportal with local and regional resources for researchers, students, and faculty. This geoportal offers metadata, web services, direct downloads, and links to external sites for more information. Each institution has a major but equal, stake in the geoportal and can select local resources, such as their state’s geospatial data or their library-owned scanned maps, for inclusion into the geoportal. The geoportal is also open to the public, providing member institutions and contributing agencies the means to increase discoverability to collections for their wider communities.\n\n#### Shared expertise\n\nThis project has also resulted in bringing together specialized expertise related to spatial data infrastructures, including geospatial metadata, application development, and data curation. Project staff members now have demonstrable expertise in the realms of metadata and application development that can be shared both within and beyond the project.\n\n#### Auxiliary staff capacity\n\nThe number of staff dedicated to GIS or cartographic cataloging activities varies between institutions. At times, a participating library may have extended periods of position vacancies or funding decisions that result in a gap in these areas of knowledge. Being able to rely upon Task Force members at other institutions to share adoptable workflows and  metadata schemas has functioned as a kind of safety net that allows libraries to continue offering services even when staff capacity is limited.\n\n####Substantial savings\n\nEach library contributes $15,000 per year to participate in the project. This covered initial development costs and continues to cover ongoing maintenance. If each library established their own geoportal, it would cost approximately $60,000 to launch and $40,000 per year to maintain ‒ an average of $44,000 over five years. This results in an estimated direct cost avoidance/savings of $29,000 per institution per year. (See this sheet for a comparison of [cost estimates for building and maintaining Geodata@Wisconsin](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fvkfobcVxjxCDcc0hWYx-nwyqWU7va3qLvvKRrZ-OUM/edit?usp=sharing))\n\n![](@images//impact-compare.png)\n\nBy aggregating the costs of each geoportal together over five years, it would result in a total of $3,120,000 for 12 institutions. By contrast, the total five-year cost of the BTAA GDP Geoportal has been $1,926,300 — $825,000 in contributed funds and $1,101,300 in in-kind support ($318,800 for UMN management, technical infrastructure, and software development support and $782,500 for Task Force Member effort). The total UMN cost per year over five years is $78,760 ($15,000 direct; $63,760 in-kind). The total cost per year over five years for other institutions is $28,041 ($15,000 direct; $13,041 in-kind).\n\n\n**Comparing Five Year Aggregated Costs: 12 Local Geoportals vs. one BTAA GDP Geoportal**\n![](@images//impact-cost3.png)\n\n\n## Impact #2: Geospatial resources are easier to find\n\n### What was the need?\n\nGeospatial resources are difficult to find for several reasons. Public data is often poorly documented with minimal or inconsistent metadata. This is further compounded by the available distribution platforms, which may have limited search capabilities, forcing users to rely upon guessing at keywords to perform searches for desired resources.\n\nOnline sources for geospatial resources are also widely dispersed across the internet. Geospatial data rarely shows up in Google searches, so in order to find specific desired datasets, users need to know which agencies, administrative bodies, or educational units produce and distribute it.\n\nFinally, many historical geospatial resources are in the form of paper maps, plat books, and atlases. If these are not digitized, users may not know about their existence or how to find them, especially if they are held by out-of-state libraries or similar institutions. \n\n### What did we do?\n\n1. built a geoportal with GeoBlacklight, an application designed for geospatial data which features specialized search functions, including normalized facets and a spatial (map-based) search interface\n2. aggregated resources into a single search point\n3. enhanced and normalized metadata for all records\n4. added both public geospatial data and scanned map images from libraries to the collection\n\n\n### What were the outcomes?\n\n#### A large collection of metadata records produced from many sources featuring a mix of geospatial resource types\n\nWith the geoportal, a user does not need to know who created the data in order to find it. Users can focus on searching by What, When, and Where. They do not have to worry about Who or Why. We have aggregated 211 collections of resources, which include:\n\n* 14,636 geospatial datasets and portals\n* 11,823 scanned maps and atlases\n* 1,608 aerial images and sets\n\n#### Users can find public geospatial data records from nine different states, as well as cartographic resources from around the world\n\n**Centerpoints of Geoportal Resources in the United States**\n![](@images//impact-analytics1.png)\n\n\n**Geoportal Resources Worldwide**\n![](@images//impact-homemap.png)\n\n\n**Location of the Geoportal Users in the United States by Metropolitan Area (2017-2019)**\n![](@images//impact-analytics2.png)\n\n\n#### Usage is increasing\n\nApril 2019 to March 2020 ‒ Pageviews: 65,175; Sessions: 12,219; Unique users: 9,265. Compared to the same time period in 2018-2019, this represents an increase in pageviews by 7%, in sessions by 19%, and in number of users by 25%.\n\n#### Users find geospatial resources in our site from external search engines\n\nFrom the period of March 2017-March 2020, we had 20,555 users. Analytics indicate that 38.6% of these users found items in the geoportal by searching in Google.\n\n#### We made several hidden collections accessible\n\nSimilar and complementary to the BTAA Cooperative Cataloging Project, the team is making unknown spatial data resources available for use by a range of patrons within and outside of our libraries. Ultimately, we are making collections of geospatial resources accessible to researchers of all types, whether they derive from our individual libraries’ collections or by our gathering open data from agencies outside of our libraries willing to share their datasets with others. Seamlessly bringing together disparate sources of geospatial data, whether in the form of datasets or georeferenced map images, makes possible novel ways researchers can tie geospatial information together with enlightening outcomes.\n\n**Spatial searching with the BTAA Geoportal\n**![](@images//impact-search.png)\nThe BTAA Geoportal utilizes bounding box geographic coordinates from the metadata record to populate a map interface. This allows users to search by location throughout large collections, such as the Sanborn Map Collections from Pennsylvania State University. Most of the participating institutions are not able to offer this feature through their own digital library applications.\n\n\n_Comments from project members that highlight the impact of our shared infrastructure and the resulting improved resource discoverability_\n\n!!! quote\n\n\"From the UW's perspective -- it has provided a place where metadata that describes geospatial research data produced on our campus can be broadly discovered by academic (and non-academic) user communities. Participating Universities can store their campus research data in an institutional repository and index metadata within the BTAA Geoportal. The geoportal serves as a value-added layer to institutional repositories – where it becomes the trusted geographic search and discovery solution for spatially-enabled content. The combination of local data repositories and the BTAA Geoportal working together helps researchers facing federal data management and broad public/open access requirements.\" - Wisconsin\n\n!!! quote\n\n\"A grad student was looking for GIS data for Twin Cities parks -- we used the geoportal to search due to the map search option (combined with \"parks\" as a keyword). It turned out that St. Paul parks were part of a Ramsey County administrative boundaries data set, which would have been hard to locate with just text searching.\" - Minnesota\n\n!!! quote\n\n\"...the BTAA platform allows much broader exposure to valuable research data like the historic Wisconsin Land Economic Inventory (Bordner Survey) data (digitized vectors from the 1930s scanned maps)\" - Wisconsin\n\n!!! quote\n\n\"It has definitely caused us to work more on getting our scanned maps up to the geoportal.\" - Michigan\n\n!!! quote\n\n\"Our Early Maps of the Americas Collection was previously only available internally, before being added into the geoportal\" - Chicago\n\n!!! quote\n\n\"A graduate student in The Spatial History of Nineteenth-Century Cities: Tokyo, London, New York course was doing a deep dive into London maps. She was particularly interested in the tourist experience during the Victorian Era. I pulled the paper maps she requested, but then showed her the geoportal. She ended up including a number of maps from the portal into her project, which she wouldn't have had access to otherwise. She mentioned maps from Michigan specifically.\" - Chicago\n\n\n\n\n## Impact #3: Big Ten Academic Alliance geospatial librarians and specialists are more connected\n\n### What was the need?\n\nA project of this type cannot be successful without individuals and their experiences, commitment, and effort being focused on a vision. A shared vision requires transitioning from individualized, site-based approaches to a team focused on long-term collaboration. To be successful, this approach requires a regular flow of information, ideas, and contributions across institutions. It also requires trust and a willingness to engage with new concepts beyond one’s specialization. The geoportal is a sustainable spatial data infrastructure only if we foster the connections among the people and institutions supporting it.\n\n### What did we do?\n\n1. recruited 1-3 Task Force members specializing in the areas of GIS, maps, metadata, and cataloging from each participating institution\n2. hold monthly meetings for the full Task Force and topical committees\n3. charge working groups as needed\n4. periodically hold “sprints,” where Task Force members spend a day focusing on making improvements or additions to needed areas. Sprints have included blog posts, help pages, and metadata cleanup\n5. provide funding for Task Force members to present about the project at conferences \n6. regularly share knowledge amongst ourselves, learning about things such as data standards, infrastructure, geospatial web services, and metadata schemas from each other\n\n### What were the outcomes?\n\n#### Regular and sustained communications between institutions\n\nThe collaboration started with three librarians and their libraries, grew into commitments from eight BTAA libraries in the form of monies and infrastructure, and later expanded to active representatives from twelve libraries. And these representatives have collaborated on multiple and diverse levels to produce an online open-access location where researchers can discover geospatial data and images for their needs on one end while we all contribute to data input from a diverse population of creators on the other. Project participants have benefitted in so many ways, strengthening communication and ties across the participating BTAA libraries.\n\n#### Improved workflows at local libraries\n\nAnother positive benefit has been our ability, through working in an open-access environment, to share the necessary tools to build and operate a successful collaborative data-input workflow. Task Force members have been able to use what they learn and implement improvements in their own libraries. For example, librarians at Michigan State University used the workflow they developed for preparing records for the BTAA Geoportal and applied it to metadata practices for all of their scanned maps (2).\n{ .annotate }\n\n2.

These institutions have teams of developers creating solutions for their local needs. The rest of the academic geospatial community benefits from this work but has not always had opportunities for input on the development of technologies.\n\nAnother divide concerns that of geospatial librarians and specialists working in academia and those GIS professionals working in local government. Each sector contains its own expertise, but they are not typically in regular communication with one another. For example, libraries have knowledge about metadata and archiving, while GIS professionals may be more focused on technical processing and data delivery. \n\n### What did we do?\n\n1. became active participants in the Geo4Lib and GeoBlacklight communities\n2. host and moderate monthly meetings of the GeoBlacklight developers and users\n3. facilitate bi-annual code sprints of GeoBlacklight\n4. provide consultation to similar projects at other institutions\n5. create documentation and deliver workshops on metadata standards and workflows\n6. communicate with data providers about harvesting their collections\n\n\n### What were the outcomes?\n\n#### We help drive directions in open-source technology for academic spatial data infrastructure\n\nWe are now a strong enough collective voice that we can help drive directions in geospatial technology, such as GeoBlacklight. Examples of specific features for GeoBlacklight that we pushed for and/or developed include the integration of ArcGIS Rest services, a Wiki for the Metadata schema, rollover help text,  and a static image plugin. We are also currently developing a metadata editor for the application, which will be especially helpful for librarians and catalogers. [This report includes more details on our contributions to GeoBlacklight.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0kAisrVAktYDEocp63wxwXmHICh3y4I09z_x8KQmjQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nNormalizing the metadata schema and associated standard from the beginning has had a positive and ongoing effect on GeoBlacklight enhancements as well as its community, benefiting many other spatial data users outside of our project.\n\n#### Data providers get more exposure to their collections\n\nHow do geospatial data providers benefit from having their information accessible through the geoportal? Perhaps most obviously, exposing their collections and content without barriers will make them known as trusted “go-to” information providers. More use of their data potentially means more opportunities for them to garner research dollars as well. \n\n\nAnother benefit to data providers has been our ability to deliver metadata workshops to individuals within agencies and libraries. A benefit in return is higher-quality metadata that allows better access to resources residing in the BTAA Geoportal.\n\n\n_Comments from project members that highlight the impact of our collaborations and leadership_\n\n\n!!! quote\n\n\"For me, it has provided a community of practice offering valuable insights, advice, and assistance in how we can all do our work better and more efficiently.\" - Wisconsin\n\n!!! quote\n\n\"Participating in the task force has been rewarding as it provides a network of geospatial librarians that regularly share what they are working on, which is a very different thing from annual/semi-annual conference attendance.\" - Chicago\n\n!!! quote\n\n\"Through my involvement, I have learned from other task force members how they are engaging with contacts in local/state agencies. Submitting public datasets for the geoportal (and presenting on it at a couple of regional/state GIS conferences) has connected me with and increased my (and OSU Libraries) visibility among local/state agency contacts in a way that would not have happened so naturally otherwise. This knowledge has helped me to connect students with those GIS professionals and draw on their expertise when needed.\" - Ohio

“Introduction”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>We have come a long way since the idea for a sustained collaboration across CIC map libraries germinated a decade ago among informal conversations between librarians and directors. This vision began to take shape in 2012 when three map librarians issued a white paper, \u003Cem>A Collaborative Vision for Spatial Scholarship across the CIC\u003C/em> (1). This paper identified geospatial data as a long-term, interdisciplinary need that would necessitate increasingly complex infrastructures to manage. The authors concluded that these infrastructures would likely be prohibitively expensive for each CIC library to maintain individually, and they proposed collaborative solutions for the long-term management of geospatial resources.\n{ .annotate }\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>Bidney, M., Mattke, R. &#x26; Weessies, K.

The geoportal is also open to the public, providing member institutions and contributing agencies the means to increase discoverability to collections for their wider communities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h4\">\u003Ch4 id=\"shared-expertise\">Shared expertise\u003C/h4>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#shared-expertise\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Shared expertise”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>This project has also resulted in bringing together specialized expertise related to spatial data infrastructures, including geospatial metadata, application development, and data curation.

'@astrojs/starlight/components';\n\n\nMost of the resources in the BTAA Geoportal are free and open, but we also include an index of licensed databases commonly accessed by researchers affiliated with a BTAA university.  The Licensed Data research guide explains how to interpret those records and access the data.\n\n\n## What does “Licensed Data” mean?\n\nLicensed data is data that is authorized for use by an individual university, or by multiple universities in the Big Ten Academic Alliance through a subscription. It is paid for by an institution for affiliates to use, unlike free public use data.\n\nLicensed data records do **not** link directly to datasets you can download like our other public geoportal records do. Download is dependent on the database itself (see database descriptions below for common uses and data format availability).\n\n## How to identify licensed data:\n\n* Under Public/Restricted” on the left bar for filtering, licensed data resources are found by filtering for “Restricted” resources. Browse all licensed data in the portal [here](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdct_accessRights_s%5D%5B%5D=Restricted&page=1&per_page=20&search_field=all_fields).\n* Under the “Rights” heading on the item record itself, there may be more specific restrictions.\n* If you see the lock icon beside the title, it is a Licensed Resource/Restricted\n\n\n## Type of access \n\nSome licensed data providers have a free version or limited version of their product where a limited number of datasets are available freely, while other datasets may only be accessible if your institution has paid for a subscription. The geoportal will send you back to your own institution’s library catalog for logging in, as each institution is different. Click the name of your institution in the bottom right of the record to be taken to your institution’s catalog.\n\n## How to get to the data\n\nIf you come across a licensed data record in the geoportal, it is an indication that the data exists in that provider’s interface. Our records try to mimic the structure or broader headings of the provider the record comes from. Collections in the geoportal record will most likely be named the same as headings in the licensed data resource, so this is one way to search. Another way is by searching the name of the dataset in the provider’s search bar, if they have one. \n\nFor example with the following Elections dataset via PolicyMap:\n\n\n1. Search by provider category or data folder\n\n    Look down under “Related Items” and see if there is a “Collection”. The name of the Collection will likely be a heading on the site’s interface. For example, Elections: Presidential is in the Demographics collection. That means that this dataset will appear under a Demographics heading on the PolicyMap site.\n\n\n2. Type the name or keyword of the record into the interface’s search bar\n\n    Whatever word you see as the name of the dataset, search in the site interface itself to look for it. Typing “elections” into the PolicyMap site itself will find this dataset in the website and then you can download from there. Some interfaces, like Social Explorer, do not have a search bar.\n\n\n## Licensed databases indexed in the BTAA Geoportal\n\n\u003CLinkCard\n  title=\"Digital Sanborn Maps (Proquest)\"\n  href=\"https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=999-0011\"\n  description=\"Sanborn fire insurance maps provide a variety of information, such as building outline, size and shape, as well as property addresses.

Lists of these resources and our notes are available within our working group folder:  \n[Land Acknowledgements Readings and Resource List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ADEF0rDSXBm2MLj6e4FTVQDa5Ny5-qah2NxwcWPZX6Q/)  \n[Digital Mapping and Indigenous America](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19hT363kjuEnXndGQOKz-fyHuo5IA0CADELNfTXFjQvY/)\n\nBased on our discussions and readings, we concluded that writing a conventional statement (i.e., something read before presentations about the Geoportal) was not the best approach.  Such statements acknowledge injustice but generally do not result in any specific actions addressing that injustice. Additionally, land acknowledgement statements typically recognize only the land around the speaker’s location, which only tells part of the story. However, most of our Network’s universities were established and endowed through the practice of selling indigenous occupied land in other parts of the country.\n\nWe recommend that if team members choose to give a land acknowledgement, it should:\n\n* Be the product of individual reflection rather than a pre-constructed script  \n* Encourage support for the contemporary, ongoing efforts and priorities of affected tribes\n\n# Next Steps\n\nThe Action Plan is a public-facing document that will be reviewed and sustained by the Steering Committee. It outlines broad commitments and proposes tangible actions the Geoportal Project Team might take to move forward on these objectives. However, it does not specify which Committees should be responsible for the work. To encourage continued action around resources impacting Indigenous communities, we propose the following steps:\n\n* Steering Committee: Reach out to community members, such as staff at the [Native Land Information System](https://nativeland.info), to get feedback on the Action Plan and approach.\n\n* CDEO(Collection Development): Review resources about tribal lands or resources created by tribally-affiliated groups in the BTAA Geoportal ([spreadsheet with example resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I7sd7gmoI4qI3Fvbo4JMX6JpTZAAG6VIpq62A1kU174/edit#gid=0)). Create criteria for the inclusion of new resources impacting Indigenous communities.\n\n* Metadata Committee: Review item records for resources to ensure that they have appropriate rights/license statements, as indicated by the data providers.\n\n* Interface, Metadata, and CDEO (Education Outreach) Committees: Explore possible methods for providing contextual information about BTAA Geoportal collections.\n\n* BTAA GIS Conference planners: Invite Indigenous researchers, cartographers, and geospatial professionals to speak about their work at the BTAA GIS Conference (and compensate them for their work).\n\n---","src/content/docs/library/land-acknowledgement-working-group-report.md","c9e37841f2b0f5ef",{"html":2084,"metadata":2085},"\u003Cp>July 2022\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h1\">\u003Ch1 id=\"overview\">Overview\u003C/h1>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#overview\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Overview”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>The Land Acknowledgement Working Group, active from March to July 2022, explored the scholarship around the idea of land acknowledgements and investigated strategies for incorporating resources and information into the BTAA-GIN websites.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h1\">\u003Ch1 id=\"deliverable\">Deliverable\u003C/h1>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#deliverable\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Deliverable”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"actionPlan\">BTAA-GIN Land Acknowledgement Action Plan\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h1\">\u003Ch1 id=\"summary-of-the-work\">Summary of the work:\u003C/h1>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#summary-of-the-work\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Summary of the work:”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>The working group read a substantial number of articles and reports about the benefits and limitations of land acknowledgements, as well as broader issues of data sovereignty and representation.

Establishing the ‘best’ approach for these complex resources is not easy due to their dissimilarity, the varied nature of their interfaces, and the different providers that supply access to these datasets.\n\n\n## Structural Questions\n\nWe started from easiest to add (Landscan) and progressed to most difficult (SimplyAnalytics). With one exception, none of the products we studied allows the geoportal to link out to individual data points within their interfaces but rather force us to link only to the front page of each resource. We debated whether to describe a single geoportal record that linked to the whole resource, or if we ought to populate the geoportal with multiple records per product to capture the variety of data points available within each. We further weighed pros and cons of linking to the resource itself or to a library catalog record for each institution. We decided to link to the library catalog record itself since that is the most stable link and the least likely to change and require an update. We chose to create parent collections for each entire resource and multiple child records per parent to describe individual data points. \n\n\n## Structuring Records\n\nThe overarching theme for entering the datasets into the portal is to try to mimic the navigation of the web interface of the resource as much as possible in terms of layer names or layout. This is to prepare the user for how the source of the licensed data will be structured when they are directed to an external site. \n\nDepending on the structure of the licensed data source and what is most logical for the user to access, the records are either organized: \n\n* by year (Landscan)\n* by state (fire insurance maps)\n* by topic category as defined by the vendor (Social Explorer, SimplyAnalytics and Policymap)\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nAny dataset that already exists in the geoportal is disqualified from being added as a record, especially if it exists in a “better” form. We give preference to original data over derived data products. For example, Social Explorer provides raw census data, while  SimplyAnalytics offers census data that has been reconfigured by a third party vendor.  We also set aside some datasets of uncertain origin, such as SimplyAnalytics’ five-year population projections. \n\nWe also determined that some records are too complicated to add based on the data structure (for instance PolicyMap, see below), and we may just add a parent record and direct the user to the resource itself.\n\n\n### Landscan\n\nThe Landscan collection is made available to institutions in annual datasets beginning in 2000. We tested creating records by institution, but ultimately found it was less complicated to go by year. We settled on adding 19 records to the geoportal, one for each year 2000 to 2018.\n\n**Database description**\n\nLandscan is a world population dataset at approximately 1 km resolution (30\" X 30\"). It represents an ambient population (average over 24 hours). The LandScan algorithm uses spatial data and imagery analysis technologies and a multi-variable dasymetric modeling approach to disaggregate census counts within an administrative boundary. Since no single population distribution model can account for the differences in spatial data availability, quality, scale, and accuracy as well as the differences in cultural settlement practices, LandScan population distribution models are tailored to match the data conditions and geographical nature of each individual country and region. Note: Due to methodology changes from year to year, direct comparison of individual pixels between years is not recommended. Click on a pixel in the map to see the population for that pixel.  For larger geographic areas, click \"search\" to select either a political unit or to draw a polygon on the map. A pop up window will provide population with gender and age breakdown for that area.\n\n\n### Digital Sanborn Maps/FIMo\n\nThe Digital Sanborn Maps from Proquest and FIMo are each separated into records by individual cities which are further collected into states. We decided to create state-level records for the geoportal, especially because many institutions only own maps for a certain state and not for the whole country. To improve searching, we added the many hundreds or thousands of place names mapped within each state into the keyword metadata field. We will create separate records for each vendor and state, we combine the comments here into one entry due to the similarity of the data structure.\n\n**FIMO Database description**\n\nThis resource contains full color detailed maps of numerous towns and cities, however generally of only the more densely settled parts of each place. They contain detailed information about city properties including building characteristics, their addresses, and in commercial areas the type of business establishment in each building.  Each town center was mapped one or even several times between 1870-1960.  Most content is from the Sanborn Fire Insurance Company, but this growing database will continue to add fire insurance maps from other publishers and other large scale maps. The database is searchable by address, by coordinates, or by a clickable map interface.\n\n**Digital Sanborn Maps Database description** \n\nThe Sanborn Maps provide detailed information about city properties including all the buildings, their addresses, and in commercial areas the type of business establishment in each building.  Each town center was mapped one or even several times between 1870-1960.   Each volume begins with a graphic index to guide the user to the correct page; each page only covers a few blocks. This database is black-and-white only, while the original paper maps used color to indicate building materials.\n\n\n### PolicyMap\n\nThe PolicyMap records are organized by the topmost grouping in the hierarchy by major topic areas (Demographics, Health, Quality of Life, etc), which was given to us by a representative from the company. This decision was made because there are only 32 major topic areas as opposed to hundreds of categories and thousands of individual data layers. The individual layers would be more difficult to track changes or added layers from the provider. Each of those 32 parent records has the layer names as child records. We elected to not include PolicyMap’s census data since it is available more readily (for GIS users) from Social Explorer.\n\n**Database description**\n\nPolicymap is an online data and mapping application that gives access to over 15,000 indicators related to housing, crime, mortgages, health, jobs, demographics and education. Data are available at all common geographies (address, block group, census tract, zip code, county, city, state, MSA) as well as unique geographies like school districts and political boundaries. Data come from both public and proprietary sources. Many of the public files are available for download. Through PolicyMap, you can access all data in interactive maps, tables, charts, reports and through a unique analytic tool. You may also upload your own address level data and share your data and interactive maps with others.\n\n\n### Social Explorer\n\nThe records for Social Explorer are organized by their layer names in the interface for attribute data. We also added data from the new SocialExplorer Geodata section to the portal using the overarching categories, which allows users to download contemporary and historical shapefiles.\n\n**Database description**\n\nCreate maps and reports from selected census statistics. 1790 to 1930: County, state and national data. 1940-2000: Census tract, county, state and national data. 2006- : ACS. Also includes religion data, U.S. Election data, UK Census 2011 data, and Ireland Religion data. Generate thematic maps for census tracts. It offers a growing selection of shapefile downloads.\n\n\n### SimplyAnalytics\n\nSimplyAnalytics was not able to provide us with a list of their layers according to how they are structured on the site. They were only able to provide a list of datasets by source (“Standard Package” and “Additional Data Sets”). We determined that the Standard Package was already covered by other sources like Social Explorer and Policy Map, therefore we only included the Additional Data Sets as records in the geoportal.  Because SimplyAnalytics allows export of shapefiles, we were keen to include SimplyAnalytics especially for layers that weren’t available elsewhere.\n\n**Database description**\n\nFormerly named SimplyMap, SimplyAnalytics is a web-based mapping tool that lets users quickly create professional-quality thematic maps and reports using powerful demographic, business, and marketing data. Maps are exportable as shapefiles.\n\n\n## Changes to the Metadata and Interface\n\nWe needed to make enhancements to the metadata and the geoportal interface to incorporate licensed data.\n\n### Metadata Fields\n\n\n1. Mediator (dct_mediator_sm): \n    1. Purpose: Allow users to select their institution when searching for restricted records\n    2. Format: a multi-valued text field that contains the names of each institution that has access to the record\n2. Access (b1g_access_s): \n    3. Purpose: Provides links to each institution\n    4. Format: This is a single-valued text field that contains a stringified hash of key-value pairs.\n3. Access Rights (dct_accessRights_sm)\n    5. Purpose: To clarify that these are restricted records and provide external links for more information\n    6. Format: This is a multi-valued text field that can contain plain text and hyperlinks\n\n### Metadata Values\n\n1. Provenance (dct_provenance_s): The licensed data pilot demonstrated that our prior convention of using short labels for institutions (i.e. Minnesota) was confusing for users. We changed this practice to write out full institution names (i.e. University of Minnesota) in both the Provenance and Mediator fields.\n2. Date Issued (dct_issued_s): We removed the Date Issued field from all licensed records. Including this date was confusing as it conflicted with temporal coverages.\n3. Type (dct_type_sm):  The licensed databases require users to query, filter, and combine data within the application. To differentiate these databases from the rest of the BTAA collections, they are given the value “Interactive Resource” in the Type field. This aligns with the [Dublin Core controlled vocabulary](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/dcmitype/InteractiveResource/).\n4. Access (b1g_access_s): This new field is made up of key-value pairs, where an institution is the key and the value is the link. As the institution names are long, we used a set of codes that represent each institution. This allows the metadata to be more concise.\n\n```\nCode | Institution\n\n01 | Indiana University\n02 | University of Illinois\n03 | University of Iowa\n04 | University of Maryland\n05 | University of Minnesota\n06 | Michigan State University\n07 | University of Michigan\n08 | Purdue University\n09 | Pennsylvania State University\n10 | University of Wisconsin-Madison\n11 | The Ohio State University\n12 | University of Chicago\n13 | University of Nebraska-Lincoln\n```\n\n\n### New Facets/Filters\n\n1. Public/Restricted: This allows users to filter records between two values (Public or Restricted). These values come from the Rights fields in the metadata, which was always present. Since we only loaded Public records in the past, this filter has not been needed.\n2. Institutional Access: This pulls from the new Mediator field and allows users to filter to their institution\n\n### Item Show Page features\n\n1. Access Rights: This displays the values from the Access Rights field and includes clickable hyperlinks\n2. Licensed Resource widget: This widget appears in the Links box. At the top is a padlock with the term “Licensed Resource.” If a user hovers over the term, the phrase, “_This resource requires authentication through one of the following institutions. Select your institution for access_.” Beneath this heading is a list of institutions and icons. Each link will take a user to a library catalog page for the resource.\t\t\n\n## Implementation\n\nWe will be implementing the changes outlined in this document through an internal reallocation of effort, rather than increased direct costs.\n\n\n## Outcomes\n\nThe recommendations and guidelines in this report will allow for the incorporation of other licensed geospatial content such as scanned & georeferenced topographic map sets.\n\nProcedure for adding records for licensed resources to the BTAA Geoportal:\n    * Contact the Project Manager & Metadata Coordinator \n    * Coordinate with other project institutions that also subscribe to the resource\n    * Based on the decisions described in this report, determine how the item records for the resource should be structured in the BTAA Geoportal\n    * Draft a description of the resource to be used in the item record\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n* Form a small group or organize a focused sprint time to create help pages to help users understand what licensed data is, how it impacts their browsing experience of the portal, and how to access it via their own institutions. Pages to be created include: \n    * Licensed data\n        * Navigating resources (for interactive applications) - find guides that exist and point to those; also, quick tips on what to use for searching the resource\n    * Sanborn - find guides that exist and point to those\n    * Public Land Survey System maps\n    * Census data (locating and accessing)\n    * [GMU guide](https://infoguides.gmu.edu/data-visualization/tools#s-lg-box-19027769) has example comparisons and text\n* Data cleanup and review \n    * Review and update the Licensed Data Inventory sheet\n    * Ensure the correct links are present for each institution’s version of the above resources\n* Ask Collection Development Committee to amend the Collection Development Policy to include licensed data resources\n* Form a small group to ensure that the descriptions for existing licensed data resources are accurate\n\n## Notes\n\n[^1]:\n    Landscan from Eastview, SimplyAnalytics from Geographic Research Inc., fire insurance maps from Proquest and FIMO, PolicyMap from The Reinvestment Fund, and Social Explorer from Social Explorer Company.","src/content/docs/library/licensed-data-implementation.md","0922c1a53260adca",{"html":2115,"metadata":2116},"\u003Cp>December 2020\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Authors:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Caroline Kayko\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Karen Majewicz\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Ryan Mattke (Lead)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Kathleen Weessies\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>The Licensed Data Working Group examined five licensed dataset types from six vendors that are held by most or all of the institutions participating in the BTAA Geoportal Project.\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fn-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1\u003C/a>\u003C/sup> Our purpose was to assess the advisability and best practices for incorporating records into the Geoportal.

It represents an ambient population (average over 24 hours). The LandScan algorithm uses spatial data and imagery analysis technologies and a multi-variable dasymetric modeling approach to disaggregate census counts within an administrative boundary. Since no single population distribution model can account for the differences in spatial data availability, quality, scale, and accuracy as well as the differences in cultural settlement practices, LandScan population distribution models are tailored to match the data conditions and geographical nature of each individual country and region. Note: Due to methodology changes from year to year, direct comparison of individual pixels between years is not recommended. Click on a pixel in the map to see the population for that pixel.  For larger geographic areas, click “search” to select either a political unit or to draw a polygon on the map. A pop up window will provide population with gender and age breakdown for that area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"digital-sanborn-mapsfimo\">Digital Sanborn Maps/FIMo\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#digital-sanborn-mapsfimo\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Digital Sanborn Maps/FIMo”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>The Digital Sanborn Maps from Proquest and FIMo are each separated into records by individual cities which are further collected into states.

DESCRIPTION OF COLLECTION SCOPE EXPANSION\n\n### 1.1 Current Operations: Metadata Curation with a Discovery Portal\n\n#### 1.1.1 Collection Policy\n\nOur current collection policy covers metadata records for geodata (open data and licensed databases) and historical scanned maps.\n\n\n-\t{==**Collection A: DATA REGISTRY**==} \n\n**1. Open Data Registry**\n\nRegularly updated registry of public geodata available from hundreds of public sites, including state and local governments, research institutes, and libraries. \n\nCuration goals:      \n                                                                                                    \n-   metadata normalization and enhancement                                                                        \n-   transformations into a schema specifically designed for       \ngeospatial resources                                                                                                             \n-   searchable by text string, dates, place names, and with a map \ninterface                                                                                                                    \n-   federated search of hundreds of sites at once.                \n                                                    \n**2.  Licensed Data Registry**\n\nIndex of all layers within complex licensed databases that various BTAA Universities subscribe to. \n\nCuration goals:                                                 \n                                                    \n-   an index of all layers within the databases                                                                                 \n-   provide normalized federated search of hundreds of sites and  \ndatabases at once.                                          \n\n-\t{==**Collection B: LIBRARY REPOSITORIES**==}                               \n                                                    \nScanned maps and geodata held at BTAA university digital libraries.   \n\nCuration goals:                                                       \n                                                    \n-   metadata improvements from regular cleanup sprints to fix         \nbounding box errors, creator normalization, date normalization, \nand application of linked data URIs.                                                                        \n-   provide normalized federated search of all geospatial resources held at BTAA libraries in one site\n-   augment search capabilities beyond typical library catalogs, including spatial and temporal searches                       \n\n\n\n#### 1.1.2 Technology Workflow (Current operations)\n\nWe rely on two open-source tools for our workflows: the BTAA Geoportal\nand GeoBlacklight Admin, a custom administrative toolkit. Both tools\nrun on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Under our current scope, we are only\nable to provide access as external links to the most recent versions\nof any dataset. When authors overwrite a public dataset, we must\nre-harvest the metadata and discard the previous version with its\nbroken access links.\n\n### 1.2 Expanded Operations: Add Data Curation with Cloud Storage\n\n#### 1.1.1 Collection Policy\n\nOur planned collection policy would continue to cover metadata records\nfor open data, licensed data, and scanned maps. It would expand to\ninclude a curated collection of public data, selectively chosen with\nthe BTAA researchers in mind. To develop this new aspect of the\ncollection policy, we will develop these four areas:\n\n-   STAFFING: Shift the focus of our Product Manager to include the role\nof Geospatial Data Curator and hire a Program and Outreach\nCoordinator to manage the increased complexity of the BTAA-GIN.\n\n-   CURATION: Collaboratively develop a curation plan that identifies\ndatasets based on criteria such as theme, geography, temporal\nrange, data quality, and administrative source.\n\n-   QUALITY CONTROL: Determine our data and metadata quality standards,\nsuch as the principles of FAIR (Findability, Accessibility,\nInteroperability, and Reuseability).\n\n-   COMMUNICATION: Create a data provider communication plan for\nobtaining historical datasets and current datasets at regular or\nas-needed intervals.\n\n\n-\t{==**New Collection C: BTAA-GIN Geodata**==}\n\nFree and open geodata curated and stored by the BTAA-GIN. Curation goals:                                                                \n                                                    \n-   capture snapshots of recently published at-risk resources that    \nwill be overwritten                                                                                                                \n-   fill in the gaps of hidden or unpublished datasets from the early \ndigital era\n-   save a historical record of the changing geospatial landscape\n-   provide a consistent user experience that minimizes broken links  \n\n\n#### 1.1.2 Technology Workflow (Expanded operations)\n\nTo incorporate data curation, we will expand the functionality of GBL\nAdmin to include data ingest and management. This will involve setting\nup cloud object storage with Amazon S3 to store and provide access to\nthe curated resources. Under our expanded scope, users will still be\nable to access current versions from the original data provider, but\nwill also be able to download historical versions.\n\n## 2. STRATEGIC ROADMAP\n\n### 2.1 Foundations & Pilot Storage (2024 Q1-Q2)\n\n#### 2.1.1 Initiate Working Group and Planning\n\n-   Establish and run the Geodata Collection Pilot Working Group.\n\n-

TECHNOLOGY STACK AND WORKFLOW\n\n### 3.1 Cloud-Based Storage Infrastructure\n\nAmazon Cloud Object Storage will serve as the primary storage solution,\nselected for its efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. It\nprovides a flat storage structure that simplifies management.\n\n### 3.2 Technology Components\n\n-   BTAA Geoportal: The main discovery portal for users.\n\n-   Solr: To index metadata, facilitating efficient searching.\n\n-   GBL Admin Toolkit: For managing metadata and datasets.\n\n-   AWS S3: The central cloud storage repository.\n\n-   AWS Serverless Applications: Enables data previews.\n\n-   AWS Glacier (Planned for future): For long-term storage needs.\n\n### 3.3 Ingest Workflow\n\n#### 3.3.1 Manual Process\n\n-   Metadata Creation:\n\n-   A curator manually creates a metadata record using the GBL Admin\nToolkit's user interface, adhering to the OpenGeometadata\nAardvark schema.\n\n-   Data Upload and Storage:\n\n-   The curator uploads the zipped geospatial dataset, bundled with\na standards-compliant metadata file, through the GBL Admin\ninterface.\n\n-   GBL Admin then pushes this dataset to an Amazon S3 bucket for\npublic access and to AWS Glacier for dark storage (future\nimplementation).\n\n-   Data Preview and Metadata Access:\n\n-   The S3 bucket integrates with serverless applications to offer\ndata previews to users.\n\n-   The curator uploads a separate standards-based XML metadata file\nvia the GBL Admin UI, which is also stored in S3. This allows\nusers to preview the metadata independently before downloading\nthe dataset.\n\n#### 3.3.2 Batch Processing\n\n-   Metadata Batch Processing\n\n-   Curators will prepare a spreadsheet containing metadata in the\nOpenGeoMetadata Aardvark schema.\n\n-   They will then upload this spreadsheet to the GBL Admin Toolkit\nto create multiple metadata records simultaneously.\n\n-   Data Batch Upload\n\n-   The method for batch uploading of datasets and associated XML\nmetadata files is yet to be defined. The future system will\nlikely allow curators to upload multiple datasets and their\nmetadata files to the GBL Admin Toolkit, which will then\nautomate the process of storing these in AWS S3 and handling\ntheir integration with serverless applications for previews.\n\n**AWS Architecture diagram**\n\n![](@images/aws-architecture.png)\n\n### 3.4 Storage and Cost Estimates\n\n#### 3.4.1 Storage Needs\n\n-   Projected to be around 1200 GB for the initial two years, based on\nan analysis of existing data volumes.\n\n-   State-Level Geospatial Clearinghouses: Approximately 100 GB per\nstate (for 11 states)\n\n-   County- and Municipal-level ArcGIS Hub Sites: Approximately 80 GB in\ntotal\n\n-   Miscellaneous Sites: An estimated 40 GB\n\n#### 3.4.2 Cost Analysis\n\nEstimated monthly storage cost of \\$27.60 based on current AWS\npricing, with additional download costs depending on usage.\n\n### 3.5 Future Considerations\n\n#### 3.5.1 Format Enhancements\n\n-   Cloud Optimized Formats: Plan to adopt Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs\n(COGs) and PM Tiles for efficient cloud storage and access.\n\n-   Serverless Data Previews: Investigate serverless solutions for data\npreview, such as Northwestern's Serverless IIIF, to enhance user\nexperience.\n\n#### 3.5.2 Exit Strategy\n\n-   Plan Development: Establish an exit strategy to ensure the safe and\nefficient transfer of digital assets if needed.\n\n-   Potential Repository Technologies:\n\n-   DSpace: Known for its stability and broad user base, using a\nmodified Dublin Core metadata schema.\n\n-   Samvera: Offers greater customization and integration with\nGeoBlacklight, using a MODS metadata schema.\n\n## 4.

It aims to improve how geospatial data is collected, managed, and used to address challenges from local to global scales.\nThe plan is built around three goals:\n\n* **Governance**: Ensure inclusive participation, clear policies, and sustainable funding.\n* **Data and Technology**: Modernize infrastructure, adopt advanced technologies like AI, and improve data quality and accessibility.\n* **People**: Develop a skilled workforce, promote partnerships, and encourage geospatial literacy.\n\nIt highlights trends such as AI, big data, open data, and privacy concerns, and emphasizes NSDI’s role in areas like disaster response, smart cities, agriculture, healthcare, and infrastructure. Success depends on collaboration across sectors, coordinated through the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC).\n\nThe **National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)**, as defined by the [Geospatial Data Act of 2018](https://www.fgdc.gov/gda), is the framework of technology, policies, standards, and personnel that supports geospatial data sharing across all levels of government and the private sector. Over the past 30 years, the NSDI has evolved from a federally led initiative to a collaborative, multi-sector effort. Key achievements include the development of governance structures, open data platforms, and geospatial tools, supported in part by the FGDC’s Cooperative Agreements Program.\n\nLooking ahead, the NSDI must adapt to address pressing national challenges—such as climate change, public health, and infrastructure—by delivering timely, integrated, and AI-ready geospatial data. The 2025–2035 strategic plan envisions a shift from siloed systems to an interoperable geospatial ecosystem that supports real-time decision-making. This transformation will require strong partnerships, technological innovation, public engagement, and alignment with related federal policies and strategies.\n\n### Vision\nThe overarching vision for the NSDI is that, by 2035, the NSDI will be a seamlessly interconnected national geospatial ecosystem.\n\n### Mission\nThe mission of the NSDI through 2035 is to deliver highly responsive, timely, dependable, and interoperable geospatial data, applications, and services that provide knowledge on demand and actionable insights to inform decisions; address local, regional, national, and global challenges; and benefit all people\n\n### Goals and Objectives\n#### Goal 1 – Governance: Implement National Governance \n**Goal 1** focuses on establishing a strong, inclusive national governance framework for the NSDI. It aims to increase participation and accountability across all sectors—Federal, State, Tribal, local governments, and the private sector—by creating clear structures, policies, and processes for managing geospatial data. This includes setting national priorities, defining standards, and improving how data is collected, shared, and used.\n\nKey objectives:\n\n* Objective 1.1: Governance and Institutions\n* Objective 1.2: Policy and Legal Framework\n* Objective 1.3: Financial Resources\n\nTogether, these efforts aim to build a well-resourced, secure, and sustainable NSDI that supports national priorities and fosters innovation.\n\n#### Goal 2 – Data and Technology: Modernize the Infrastructure and Leverage Advanced Technology\n**Goal 2** focuses on modernizing the NSDI by adopting advanced technologies—such as AI and space-based positioning systems—to make geospatial data more accessible, accurate, and useful. The aim is to reduce the effort required to manage geospatial data while enhancing national resilience, economic growth, and informed decision-making.\n\nKey objectives:\n\n* Objective 2.1: Data\n* Objective 2.2: Innovation and Research\n* Objective 2.3: Standards\n* Objective 2.4: Infrastructure\n\nTogether, these efforts aim to create a dynamic, user-friendly, and future-ready geospatial infrastructure.\n\n#### Goal 3 – People: Building a Skilled Geospatial Workforce for a Sustainable Future\n**Goal 3** emphasizes the importance of people in the success of the NSDI. It focuses on building a skilled, knowledgeable, and engaged geospatial workforce while raising awareness of spatial thinking and geospatial technologies across all sectors of society.\n\nKey objectives:\n\n* Objective 3.1: Partnerships\n* Objective 3.2: Capacity and Education\n* Objective 3.3: Communication and Engagement\n\nTogether, these efforts aim to create a geospatially literate society and a workforce capable of driving innovation and addressing complex challenges through the NSDI.\n\n### Core Values\nThe NSDI is built on a set of core values that ensure its effectiveness, sustainability, and societal benefit. Central to these values is the principle of “build once, use many times,” promoting efficient, cost-effective data creation that serves multiple purposes. The FAIR principles—findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability—ensure that geospatial data is easy to locate, widely accessible, compatible across systems, and preserved for future use. Additional values include Dependability, Quality, Collaboration, Innovation, Transparency, Sustainability, User-centric design, Data security, and Data sovereignty. Check out the full list on the [FGDC NSDI Strategic Plan site](https://www.fgdc.gov/nsdi-plan/).\n\n### Outlook and Trends \nAs the NSDI Strategic Plan is implemented over the next decade, it must remain adaptable to evolving technologies and shifting priorities. Check out the full list of outlooks and trends on the [FGDC NSDI Strategic Plan site](https://www.fgdc.gov/nsdi-plan/).\n\n### 2035 Use Cases\nBy 2035, a fully developed and sustainable NSDI will support a wide range of applications across land, water, and space, serving diverse sectors and disciplines. Check out the full list of use cases on the [FGDC NSDI Strategic Plan site](https://www.fgdc.gov/nsdi-plan/).\n\n## Next Steps \nTo achieve the ambitious goals of the NSDI Strategic Plan, it is essential for all sectors—Federal, State, Tribal, local governments, private industry, academia, and nonprofits—to actively contribute their unique strengths and expertise. The success of the NSDI depends on broad, coordinated participation, as the Nation’s security and economic well-being are increasingly tied to effective geospatial data use and innovation. This strategic plan serves as a guiding framework for all stakeholders to develop and monitor their contributions, ensuring a unified and measurable path toward realizing the NSDI vision.\nCheck out the full [NSDI Strategic Plan 2025-2035](https://www.fgdc.gov/nsdi-plan)!","src/content/docs/library/nsdi-strategicplan2035.md","3dda6f5954f5c8e1",{"html":2420,"metadata":2421},"\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#introduction\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Introduction”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>As the BTAA Geospatial Information Network (GIN) continues to grow and evolve—particularly through our Geoportal infrastructure rebuild—it’s important to reflect on how our regional efforts align with national geospatial priorities.

We were to assess the practicality and effectiveness of our current solution and make recommendations for any changes. The three issues that we focused on included:\n\n1. Discoverability: As of 2022, these documents are hosted in Google Drive and findable through our project Google Sites website. These are not broadly discoverable unless someone is on our site - in which case they might not be looking for this kind of material.\n2. Accessibility: These documents were created before the BTAA-GIN articulated and prioritized DEIA goals of accessibility. Our content should be updated to incorporate accessibility issues as much as possible. \n3. Persistence: Google Drive documents are generally owned by an individual. If that individual leaves their position, we need to work through a series of steps to make sure the content remains online. There are other repositories and file formats that are more stable.\n\n\n## What we did\n\n* Identified and organized target resources\n    * Identified existing GIN public content to be addressed and gathered it onto  one webpage that includes Step by step tutorials, Research Guides, and Best Practices.\n    * Moved all other content to Documentation or Geoportal Help.\n* Researched Accessibility issues\n    * Reviewed tutorial page with [NVDA screen reader](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) and [Axe plug-in](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en-US) for Mozilla Firefox.\n    * Reviewed accessibility of Google Slides presentation using NVDA screen reader, [Deque Color Content Analyzer](https://dequeuniversity.com/color-contrast), and Adobe PowerPoint Accessibility Review Tool.\n    * See [separate document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mkxXWwOKmiVMoBZxu9CkDpHF18d2j15/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106182567550693215185&rtpof=true&sd=true) for fuller accessibility review.\n    * Contacted the University of Michigan Digital Accessibility Team for recommendations on Google Slides vs. PowerPoint vs. OpenOffice, but no clear winner.\n* Researched & Tested Platforms\n    * We explored other BTAA projects and other multi-institutional projects which serve out public-facing documentation. Most or all BTAA Library Initiative groups use hosting from one of the member organizations. Some groups utilize github, but no one platform has emerged as a clear favorite. \n    * We used one BTAA GIN tutorial as a test and copied the content into the following platforms to see how easy it was, how long it took, and how much it would improve accessibility.\n\n\n### Platform Feature Matrix\n\n\u003Ctable>\n  \u003Ctr>\n   \u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Platform\u003C/strong>\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Discoverability\u003C/strong>\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Accessibility\u003C/strong>\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Preservability\u003C/strong>\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Ease of Use and Team Access\u003C/strong>\n   \u003C/td>\n  \u003C/tr>\n  \u003Ctr>\n   \u003Ctd>Google Slides\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>not indexed\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>weak\n   \u003C/td>\n   \u003Ctd>tied to individual accounts;

\n* Images should be reviewed to ensure they have alt-text or are marked as decorative;\n* We may wish to remove purely decorative elements (logos, horizontal rules, gray triangles) or to make these part of a background image to reduce the number of elements that need to be marked as “decorative” for screen reader applications;  \n* Alternatively, audio voiceover could be added to mitigate most issues encountered with a screen reader.\n\n3.\nIf slide content is migrated to GitHub Pages or Google Site, review impact on accessibility and mitigate any lost accessibility information (e.g. alt-text, browseable headings).\n\n\n### Persistence\n\n1. Migrate to a Google Shared drive for all Google documents\n2. Utilize the GitHub public organization account (geobtaa) for Markdown documents.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. The Steering and Education Outreach Committees need to conduct further conversations about each platform’s benefits and barriers. Should multiple formats/platforms be used?\n2. The BTAA-GIN should hold group workshops for the Program Team to learn Markdown.\n3. Provide accessibility training and/or guidelines for creating new original content.\n\n----------\n\nDate: October 31, 2022\n\n## Working Group Members: \n\n* Karen Majewicz, Organizer\n* Caroline Kayko\n* Sue Oldenburg\n* Ronda Sewald\n* Kathleen Weessies","src/content/docs/library/original-content.md","8a83e2d27da5f91a",{"html":2496,"metadata":2497},"\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"what-problem-was-addressed-by-this-group\">What problem was addressed by this group?\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#what-problem-was-addressed-by-this-group\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “What problem was addressed by this group?”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>The working group focused on the BTAA-GIN authored documents available on our public-facing websites, primarily our tutorials, collection guides, and reports.

For example, `india*` retrieves India, Indiana, Indianapolis, the Indian Ocean, etc.\n\n### Wildcard\n\nThe question mark `?` will represent any single character and must be repeated to represent multiple characters in a query.\nFor example, india? will only retrieve Indian, while india* above retrieved any number of characters after india. \n\nSimilarly, a search for `india???????` will retrieve only Indianapolis because we put 7 question marks after india and therefore any results must be words 12 characters long.\n\nfind out more information about an item?\nLook at the Links box on the right side of the item page.\n\n## Facets\n\nThe facets on the homepage and search results page can filter results by various categories.\n\n* Place: a text  filter for place names that were assigned to the resource by a cataloguer\n* Resource Class: allows users to filter by only Datasets, Maps, Web Services, Imagery, Websites, Collections, or Other.\n* Resource Type: a further refinement that describes geometry type for datasets and cartographic genres for maps\n* Year: a widget that a user can limit years by typing in a start and/or end date\n* Time Period: an aggregated grouping of dates by century, half-century, decade, or half-decade\n* Language: the language(s) of the map or dataset\n* Creator: a person or organization that directly developed the resource. For maps, in may include the surveyor, cartographer, and lithographer.  For geospatial data, it can include names of specific individuals or agencies.\n* Provider: The source, host, or distributor of the resource\n* Public/Restricted: Public records can be accessed by anyone. Restricted records require an institutional login or authentication protocal to access.\n* Institutional Access: This facet filters the restricted records by which institutions subscribe and provide access.\n* Georeferenced: To indicate whether or not a scanned map or other imagery has a georeferenced version.\n* Georeferenced via Allmaps Plugin:  To filter all of the maps hosted via a IIIF manifest with a count of how many have been georeferenced with an external service, [AllMaps](https://allmaps.org)\n\n## Advanced search\n\nThe Advanced search page facilitates combining multiple keywords and facetted searches.  To open an advanced search, look for the word \"Advanced\" next to the text search box.\n\n![](@images/help-advanced.png)\n\n## Map search\n\n### Option 1: Browse for records using a geographic extent\n\nThe interactive world map on the homepage supports map-based searches for specific places. One way to conduct a map-based search is to locate all items within a geographic extent. A user can pan the map with the mouse and zoom with the controls in the upper left corner. When the desired area is in view, click the blue Search here button at the lower left. Items that are within the geographic extent will display in the search results. Only part of an item needs to be in the geographic extent to appear in the search results. \n\n![](@images/help-zoom.gif)\n\n### Option 2: Drill down using the cluster and marker icons\n\nA second option for map-based searching is to click on the icons that appear on the map as you pan and zoom. Blue marker icons show the center point of a single item record. Cluster icons represent many item records. Click or zoom in on clusters to display blue markers corresponding to specific items. Click on a single blue marker icon, and then click the link in the popup to display that specific item record. \n\n![](@images/help-cluster.gif)","src/content/docs/library/search-strategies.md",[2579,2580,2581,2582],"@images/help-homepage.jpg","@images/help-advanced.png","@images/help-zoom.gif","@images/help-cluster.gif","d89da5e3c1d86ccf",{"html":2585,"metadata":2586},"\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"text-searches\">Text searches\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#text-searches\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Text searches”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>The homepage and the search results page feature a text search box that will scan the metadata for all of the items.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstarlight-image-zoom-zoomable>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;@images/help-homepage.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003Cbutton aria-label=\"Zoom image\" class=\"starlight-image-zoom-control\">\u003Csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"currentColor\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cuse href=\"#starlight-image-zoom-icon-zoom\">\u003C/use>\u003C/svg>\u003C/button>\u003C/starlight-image-zoom-zoomable>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"wildcards\">Wildcards\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#wildcards\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Wildcards”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Searching with either an asterisk \u003Ccode dir=\"auto\">*\u003C/code> or a question mark \u003Ccode dir=\"auto\">?\u003C/code> in your query is a way to capture more results and cast a wider search net.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"truncation\">Truncation\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#truncation\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Truncation”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>The asterisk * will search for any number of characters after your initial phrase, including zero.

The Big Ten itself has expanded, welcoming four new institutional partners in the past year. As we incorporate new geospatial resources from Washington, Oregon, and California into the BTAA Geoportal, our collection (already over 100,000 records) will continue to increase. At the same time, the BTAA-GIN Geodata Collection has introduced new demands for asset storage and metadata management. \n\nTo keep pace, we have taken a step back to assess what is working, what needs improvement, and how we can continue to build and maintain a resilient, future-compatible technology framework. To guide this process, we articulated a set of [**Technical Values**](../about/technical-values.md) that embrace resilience, growth, community, and interoperability. \n\nWith these principles in mind, we turned to identifying our core technology requirements, approaching the task as if we were starting from the ground up. At the top of our list is stable storage for both metadata and datasets that remains reliable regardless of changes to platforms or applications. In addition, we identified two essential tools: an administrative workflow system and a public-facing discovery interface. Our current technology stack meets these needs.\n\nWhat we lack, however, is a dedicated **metadata service** that operates independently of any single application. Our current technology stack functions as a silo, requiring all access and use to flow through the Geoportal. We envision a shared registry of geospatial metadata records that welcomes contributions from multiple stakeholders and supports broad reuse. Transitioning from a traditional catalog to a metadata service will allow us to repurpose and redistribute our records across a wider range of systems and uses. By making the metadata available through an **API** as easily parsable web services, any BTAA institutional service will be able to access, display, and build upon our shared collection.\n\nWith this model in mind, we then evaluated our chosen **discovery platform**, GeoBlacklight. It has long been the cornerstone of our technology stack, but the version we use is aging, and the next major release introduces major changes that would require a time-consuming rebuild. Until now, few alternatives have offered comparable features. However, a new metadata API opens the door to a simpler, more adaptable Geoportal built on top of this service.  Given our evolving needs, especially around metadata lifecycle management and file storage, we asked ourselves: should we reinvest in GeoBlacklight, or is there a better path forward?\n\nDrawing on our Technical Values, core requirements, and current technology assessment, we created a **Vision** that emphasizes modularity, interoperability, and prioritizing data over specific software solutions. Many existing tools, including our metadata editor and Amazon S3 storage, will stay in place. New components, including a metadata API and a lightweight front-end application, will strengthen our ability to manage and serve geospatial information.\n\nThis transition creates exciting **opportunities**. A modular architecture allows us to update or refine individual components without disrupting the entire system. Adopting modern, widely supported frameworks lowers barriers and encourages a broader range of contributors to participate. An API-driven approach makes metadata more accessible, supporting not just our Geoportal but other repositories and services across the BTAA and beyond. However, we also recognize potential **risks**. Departing from the established GeoBlacklight code base may reduce synergy with a community that has developed specialized geospatial features, and we will need to recreate or adapt these functionalities in our new framework. \n\nUltimately, we believe this shift will provide **increased stability**, because it addresses two of our biggest, interrelated, vulnerabilities: our reliance on a single developer’s specialized skill set and tying all of our resources to a single piece of open-source software. By adopting a modular, widely-used technology stack, we broaden our pool of potential collaborators and decouple our data from the inherent ephemerality of software. Moreover, this approach makes building lightweight discovery systems more accessible for any institution. As we evolve, we remain committed to promoting collaboration beyond GeoBlacklight by fostering a more inclusive, technology-agnostic “Geo-Libraries” **community**.\n\nThis Strategic Technology Plan outlines our next steps, focusing on four priority projects that balance ongoing work with needed upgrades. Our roadmap centers on the 2025-26 fiscal year, setting the stage for a gradual evolution of our infrastructure. Testing and proof-of-concept development will begin in **Q3 2025**, with full production rollout expected by **mid-2026**.\n\n## Technology Assessment\n\nThis section provides an overview of our current technology stack (as of February 2025), our architecture framework, a critical assessment of GeoBlacklight, and recommendations for future tools.\n\n### Current Technology Stack Overview\n\n#### 1. Software Applications\n\n* **BTAA Geoportal**: A custom web application built on GeoBlacklight, an open-source GIS discovery and indexing framework that utilizes Blacklight (a discovery framework using Ruby on Rails and Solr for indexing).  \n* **GBL Admin Toolkit:** A custom-built metadata management tool, developed with Kithe and Ruby on Rails.\n\n#### 2. Infrastructure & Hosting\n\n* Applications are hosted on AWS.  \n* Assets such as data, derivatives, and metadata are stored in Amazon S3.  \n* All development work is maintained in public GitHub repositories.\n\n#### 3. Data Management & Storage\n\n* The BTAA Geoportal primarily functions as an index of materials hosted at member libraries and has not historically stored any resources.  \n* A Geodata Collection pilot was recently completed to begin collecting assets, now stored in S3.\n\n#### 4. Analytics & Performance Monitoring\n\n* Matomo tracks user statistics and behavior.  \n* Tableau dashboard displays Matomo analytics.  \n* Google Search Console provides insights into search terms directing users to the site.  \n* AppSignal monitors site performance and alerts on slowdowns or heavy traffic.\n\n#### 5. Support tools\n\n* Jupyter Notebooks for batch metadata harvesting and data processing  \n* GitHub Pages for documentation  \n* GitHub Projects for project management\n\n### Current Architecture Framework\n\nOur current technology architecture is designed as a closed system. Our management tool (GBL Admin) pushes to Amazon S3 for data storage, a PostGRES database for metadata, and Solr for indexing. GBL Admin and the BTAA Geoportal share the same Solr instance. The architecture reflects the requirements of our chosen frontend application, GeoBlacklight, which requires a flat metadata schema served via Solr.\n\n![Current tech stack as of 2024](@images/current-tech-stack.png)\n\n*Current architecture framework for the BTAA Geoportal*\n\n\n### Critical Assessment of GeoBlacklight\n\n#### Why did we choose GeoBlacklight in 2015?\n\n* GeoBlacklight was the best option available for academic/library applications.\n\n* Ruby on Rails was the dominant framework for library web development teams.\n\n* GeoBlacklight was part of the Blacklight ecosystem, promising stability.\n\n* It had a small but engaged developer community, supported through Geo4LibCamp.\n\n* The GeoBlacklight schema provided an easy-to-adopt geospatial metadata profile.\n\n#### What has changed since 2015?\n\n* Our project requirements have evolved: we now need workflow tools, file storage, geodata collection management, metadata enrichment, and gazetteer-based concordances for linked data. GeoBlacklight’s limited scope (discovery-side only) does not provide these essential features.\n\n* Many institutions have adopted GeoBlacklight over the years. There are over a dozen listed on the GeoBlacklight website. However, many institutions also struggled with the platform and were never able to implement it. Several of those who succeeded ended up abandoning it, as they could not keep up with security patches and new developments.\n\n* Several key GeoBlacklight developers have moved on, and community contributions have slowed significantly.\n\n* Ruby on Rails framework adoption is declining, raising longer-term staffing and maintainability concerns.\n\n* New frameworks provide better options for faster development cycles, higher uptime/availability, and easier scalability.\n\n* The OpenGeoMetadata Aardvark metadata profile has proven to be more accessible, community engaging, and enduring than the GeoBlacklight software stack.\n\n\n#### GeoBlacklight’s strengths\n\n* It offers stronger **geo-focused discovery features** than many general-purpose digital library platforms, including several filters, location-based searching, and uniform place names.\n\n* It includes **previews** for many specialized geospatial and image web services.\n\n* It uses a **standardized metadata** application profile, enabling interoperability across institutions.\n\n* A dedicated **community** has grown over the past decade to guide progress and provide support.\n\n* Users praise its clean and simple interface **design** and find it easy to use.\n\n#### GeoBlacklight’s weaknesses\n\n* Few maintainers:  with only a few active contributors, new development has slowed to largely maintenance releases. \n\n* Less common code framework:  most members of the GIS community are more comfortable working with Python/Javascript than with Ruby on Rails\n\n* Poor developer ergonomics:  the development and maintenance of Rails Engines, like GeoBlacklight, is inherently slow. Most changes to the codebase require deleting and regenerating a local copy of the full application stack, which can be extremely time intensive.\n\n* No built-in metadata workflow tools:  makes GeoBlacklight adoption and setup harder.\n\n* Monolith architecture:  the software’s design is not modular, which makes custom changes difficult. Relying entirely on flattened metadata structure in Apache Solr for data storage makes relational-database enrichment challenging.\n\n* Flat metadata schema:  GeoBlacklight uses the non-relational Apache Solr search engine for indexing and storing data, which prohibits object enrichment via associated SQL joins in a relational-database environment.\n\n* Performance concerns:  with increased AI bot traffic, it has become challenging to meet production response time expectations. This is not solely an issue for (Geo)Blacklight-based apps, but the GBL stack was never inherently performant from the outset.\n\n* Upstream Blacklight technology decisions create significant challenges for GeoBlacklight applications downstream:  with limited insight and zero optionality, technology decisions cascade into GeoBlacklight from above. Examples:\n\n  * Despite many Blacklight v7 dependent GeoBlacklight applications in production, there will be no Blacklight v7 release with Rails v8 support.\n\n  * Adopting ViewComponents introduced a paradigm that makes upgrading and migrating local customizations from GBLv4 to GBLv5 significantly harder.\n\n  * The Blacklight development team changed their preferred Rails front-end technology stack to ImportMaps and broke GeoBlacklight’s continuous integration tests for several weeks.\n\n##### Frameworks that will need upgrades soon\n\nSoftware that reaches \"end of life\" no longer gets official updates or security patches. This leaves older systems open to security threats and missing new features.\n\nGeoBlacklight 4.4.2 (our current version) relies on several frameworks that are nearing end of life :\n\n* Blacklight v7: no official support for Ruby on Rails 8\n\n* Ruby on Rails 7.2: security support on ends on August 2026\n\n* Older ES5 JavaScript, which works in current browsers but is out-of-date\n\n* jQuery, which most modern frameworks do not require\n\n* Bootstrap 4, which ended support in 2023\n\n##### Future Changes\n\nThe GeoBlacklight Community recently introduced GeoBlacklight v5.0 that does use modern frameworks. However, upgrading the BTAA Geoportal to GeoBlacklight 5.0 would require extensive time and skill. We anticipate that this would take, at minimum, 8 weeks of work spread out over 4 months. We do not currently have a strategy in place to upgrade.\n\n### Recommendations for the future technology stack\n\n#### Plan for long-term stability\n\n  Without significant upgrades, the current GeoBlacklight platform risks falling short of our long-term performance and reliability needs.\n\n#### Modernize our approach\n\nInstead of spending months upgrading to GeoBlacklight version 5, we should use that time to implement a new decoupled application architecture that allows the BTAA Geoportal to prosper outside the constraints of GeoBlacklight. The new system will handle traffic better, keep security up to date, and adapt well to future needs. A simpler, more flexible platform will help the Geoportal stay fast, cost-effective, and ready for growth. The tools we choose should be well-documented, widely used, and supported by large, active open-source communities.\n\n#### Proposed transition\n\n1. Shift to GIS community-familiar technologies like Python-based tooling and PostgreSQL/PostGIS. \n\n2. Transition to industry-standard web frameworks like FastAPI and React. \n\n3. Separate the backend API from the frontend discovery interface to modularize development and deployment. \n \n\n## Vision\n\n### Statement\n\nWe envision a technology approach that supports long-term geospatial information collection and sharing. Because we value durability, we will store metadata in a relational database while hosting datasets in secure cloud storage. We will adopt a modular technology stack that fosters resilience and growth, so each component can be updated or replaced as usage grows and needs evolve. We will share metadata through an open API to ensure it remains accessible even if the underlying management and discovery tools change. Finally, to encourage adoption and contributions from the geospatial community, we will choose widely used tools that are likely to align with their existing skills.\n\n### Core Technology Needs\n\n| Component | Technology | Purpose | Changes to current stack |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| Asset storage | Amazon S3 | Store datasets | \\- |\n| Metadata database | PostgreSQL | Store metadata | \\- |\n| Management tool | GBL Admin | Administrative workflow tool | \\- |\n| Metadata API | FastAPI (Python) | Serve metadata to discovery application(s) | NEW: We will expose our metadata as APIs, which multiple schemas and filters available |\n| Discovery application | React (Javascript) | Frontend user interface | CHANGED: The API will allow us to adopt a more lightweight and modern platform. |\n\n\n### New Technology Stack Diagram\n\n![Proposed Tech Stack](@images/strategic-tech-plan.png)\n\n\n\n## Priority Projects for Technology 2025-2026\n\n### P1. Develop a Metadata API\n\nDesign and implement a metadata API using the FastAPI framework. The API will serve as a central access point for sharing metadata records. It will support integration with a variety of frontend applications and provide filtered metadata outputs for reuse. We will document its schema and endpoints to facilitate community adoption.\n\n### P2. Build a new frontend for the BTAA Geoportal\n\nCreate a lightweight discovery interface using the React framework. This new frontend will consume metadata from the API and decouple the interface from the current GeoBlacklight system. We will reuse existing GeoBlacklight JavaScript components where feasible, while simplifying the architecture to improve performance and maintenance needs.\n\n### P3. Address the evolving needs of the BTAA-GIN Geodata Collection\n\nAs we transition into **Phase 3: Foundation** of the **Geodata Collection Strategic Plan**, we remain dedicated to addressing the evolving needs of the collection. This involves iteratively developing based on workgroup recommendations, conducting user testing, and adapting to emerging priorities.\n\n### P4. Foster the Geo-Libraries Community\n\nFor over five years, we have served as de facto leaders of the GeoBlacklight community, guiding its development and supporting adopters. However, as the community grapples with the evolving direction of the Blacklight framework, we recognize the need for a broader approach. Our commitment to open-source collaboration remains strong, with a new focus on fostering the Geo-Libraries Community, a space for geospatial professionals in libraries to engage with metadata standards, GIS tools, and discovery frameworks beyond a single software platform.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n![Roadmap chart](@images/tech-roadmap-2025.png)","src/content/docs/library/tech-plan-2025.md",[2689,2690,2691],"@images/current-tech-stack.png","@images/strategic-tech-plan.png","@images/tech-roadmap-2025.png","9c02c0d9106e639d",{"html":2694,"metadata":2695},"\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#introduction\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Introduction”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>As our program grows, so do our technological needs.

She has extensive experience working with archival material, but little motivation to learn how to use digital geospatial tools as she is nearing retirement.\n  \n### Story\n                \nAs a historical researcher and seminar instructor, I am looking for an intuitive, quick, and non-technical tool for finding historical maps by place and time.\n\n### Scenario\n\nI have used the geoportal to find digitized South Asian maps for my research and lecture slides. By using the map search option in combination with the date facet, I can easily locate maps from a specific geographic area and time period.\n\n\n                                           \n![person icon](@images//hannah.png)\n## Hannah: The busy, tech-savvy undergrad\n\n### Profile          \n  \nHannah is a third year undergraduate student with a heavy course load. She is taking her second GIS course and is looking to get more experience with using geospatial tools and data.\n\n### Story\n\nAs an undergraduate student, I am looking for a one-stop shop for finding public geospatial data.\n\n### Scenario\n\nI needed to complete an assignment for my Advanced GIS course quickly. The deliverable was a map of Wisconsin and Illinois featuring highways, parks, lakes, and terrain. I used the geoportal to search by state and found all of these datasets. This saved me time from having to search through DOT and DNR GIS websites for both states.\n\n\n\n![person icon](@images//lee.png)\n## Lee: The advanced researcher\n\n\n### Profile \n\nLee is a graduate student studying hydrology. They regularly use GIS applications for spatial analysis.\n\n### Story\n\nAs someone who evaluates a great deal of data, I am looking for a more efficient way to preview items online before downloading them.\n\n### Scenario\n\nMy research is focused on the Great Lakes. The agency that publishes bathymetry for the lakes provides the data as downloadable shapefiles hosted on a file server. They don’t have previewable metadata, so I have to download each item, unzip it, and load it into a desktop GIS application to determine what attributes are present. With the geoportal, I can preview a visualization of the dataset and select features to see what the attribute table contains. I can also preview the metadata from right within the item page.\n\n\n\n![person icon](@images//edgar.png)\n## Edgar: The librarian\n\n### Profile \n\nEdgar is a Geography Liaison at a University Library. He is an experienced GIS user and regularly consults with students to help them find data for research projects.\n\n### Story\n\nAs a liaison who regularly works with researchers, I want a catalog of local public GIS data that features a spatial search.\n\n### Scenario\n\nAs a librarian, I would like to be able to use a more responsive search interface for materials in our collections.\nOur institution uses an outdated platform for our digital collections. I am directing students to the geoportal to search for our unique collection of maps. This will also provide better discoverability for this unique collection for researchers at other Big Ten Universities.\n\n\n![person icon](@images//scott.png)\n## Scott: The data provider\n\n### Profile \n\nScott is a GIS Professional in a small county in Ohio. He began using GIS in 1993, years before online data sharing was possible. \n\n### Story\n\nAs an employee of an agency with limited funding, I am glad to know there is an external organization that is willing to add value to our public data with metadata and up-to-date sharing platforms.\n\n### Scenario\n\nI support the idea of open data in general, but we only have time to fulfill the basic county mandate to make our GIS data publicly available. We don’t have the resources in my department to spend time improving our county’s GIS website, so having our data indexed in the Geoportal makes it easier for people to find\n\nI also have a great deal of historical GIS data that I store on a hard drive. My county website only allows me to publish the most recent versions of the data, but I would like to make the historical versions available somewhere.\n\n\nCompiled by the User Personas and Stories Working Group June 29, 2018 - September 6, 2018","src/content/docs/library/user-personas.md",[2798,2799,2800,2801,2802],"@images//sofiya.png","@images//hannah.png","@images//lee.png","@images//edgar.png","@images//scott.png","2ac2829b770412a5",{"html":2805,"metadata":2806},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstarlight-image-zoom-zoomable>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;@images//sofiya.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;person icon&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003Cbutton aria-label=\"Zoom image: person icon\" class=\"starlight-image-zoom-control\">\u003Csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"currentColor\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cuse href=\"#starlight-image-zoom-icon-zoom\">\u003C/use>\u003C/svg>\u003C/button>\u003C/starlight-image-zoom-zoomable>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"sofiya-the-social-science-professor\">Sofiya: The Social Science professor\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#sofiya-the-social-science-professor\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Sofiya: The Social Science professor”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"profile\">Profile\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#profile\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Profile”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Sofiya is a tenured History professor.

However, after the survey of Associate University Librarians indicated interest in exploring geospatial web services across the participating BTAA Geoportal institutions, it became clear that we needed to expand the scope of our work to include a broader discussion of web services, technologies and workflows. \n\nUnderstanding the basics of what web services are and how they are created brings to light potential pathways forward and a clearer understanding of the work involved. Because of varying levels of access to the primary platforms used in creating web services, we approached our technology research in two ways. We reviewed ArcGIS Online workflows using a hands-on approach, accessing the Big Ten Academic Alliance ESRI Organizational account directly. However, in researching the open-source platform GeoServer, we relied on informative interviews and experiences from experts at Princeton University. The following report provides information about what web services are, how they might benefit geoportal users, what technologies might be used to create them, how collection development and metadata are impacted, and the advantages or disadvantages to different approaches of implementation.\n\n## What is a geospatial web service?\n\nA geospatial web service is a GIS resource (e.g., data, map) that allows users to preview, visualize, and repurpose data in web maps and applications without having to download or host a new copy. Geospatial web services depend on a server-side / client-side relationship. That server may be on premises or may utilize cloud-based infrastructure, and those clients can access, combine, and (in some cases) contribute information back to web services from different sources without the need for local hosting on their own infrastructure.\n\nDifferent types of geospatial web services exist, with two of the most common and relevant for our purposes being Web Feature Services (WFS) and Web Map Tile Services (WMTS).  \n \n\n1. A web feature service is a dynamic, read-only service useful for directly exposing data for display and querying in a web map or web mapping application. Example: [Web Feature Service](https://gis2.metc.state.mn.us/arcgis/rest/services/bdry_metro_counties_and_ctus/FeatureServer).  \n2. A web map tile service is a dynamic, read-only service that supports fast visualization from a collection of predrawn images (tiles) but does not allow direct access to data about individual features. Example: [Web Map/Map Tile Service](https://gis2.metc.state.mn.us/arcgis/rest/services/bdry_metro_counties_and_ctus/MapServer).\n\nThe role of web GIS in the geospatial industry continues to expand and evolve, and it is in this context that geospatial web services have become an important mechanism for distributing geospatial information. By linking to a web service hosted by an authoritative data provider, users are able to display the most accurate and up-to-date information available in their web maps and applications.  This decreases duplicate versions that may become out of sync if corrections or updates are made by the data provider.  Geospatial web services can also pose a challenge though for users seeking to directly access the data on which those web services have been built, as a user’s ability to download those data may be limited by the settings configured by the owner of that web service or, when the configurations allow for data querying/download, may require additional skills to carry out the necessary steps in a desktop GIS. \n\n## Benefits of web services\n\nWithin the context of the BTAA geoportal project, providing web services would have a number of potential benefits:\n\n1. *Ability to preview data before downloading.*  Web services allow users to view the spatial extent and attributes of a dataset without needing to open it in a geospatial software. Example: [Bike Lanes: Detroit Michigan](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/4b886654a8d846a782658bd4712e7952_0)  \n2. *More consistent display and user experience for geospatial data.* A large number of the geospatial datasets available through the geoportal already have associated web services. Hosting web services for data that do not currently have them would support a more consistent user experience for records from across institutions and data sources.      \n3. *Incentive for researchers to use the geoportal.* Creating geospatial web services from data hosted in institutional repositories could benefit researchers who do not otherwise have a stable place to visualize their data. This could also possibly benefit collection development by increasing the number of unique datasets available through our geoportal.  \n\nRoughly half of our current geospatial datasets do not have an associated web service, although the percentage varies between institution:\n\n#### Geospatial Data Records in the BTAA Geoportal (Oct 2019\\)\n\n| Institution | With web services | Without web services | Percent w/o web services |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Wisconsin | 41 | 2,902 | 99% |\n| Michigan | 11 | 106 | 91% |\n| Penn  State | 436 | 1,515 | 78% |\n| Minnesota | 347 | 710 | 67% |\n| Chicago | 168 | 285 | 63% |\n| Illinois | 69 | 120 | 63% |\n| Maryland | 2,111 | 824 | 28% |\n| Iowa | 854 | 99 | 10% |\n| Purdue | 273 | 18 | 6% |\n| Ohio State | 1,107 | 27 | 2% |\n| Indiana | 159 | 0 | 0% |\n| Michigan State | 450 | 0 | 0%  |\n| **Total** | **6,026** | **6,606** | **52%** |\n\n \n\n## Overview of web service technologies\n\nWe investigated two options for hosting web services to compare both open source and proprietary solutions \\- GeoServer and ArcGIS Online respectively.   \n\n### GeoServer ([http://geoserver.org/](http://geoserver.org/)) \n\nGeoServer is an open-source Java application server that supports the development, hosting, and sharing of dynamic map and data online services. It is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant implementation of a number of open standards such as Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Map Service (WMS), and Web Coverage Service (WCS). Additional formats and publication options are available including Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) and extensions for Catalogue Service (CSW) and Web Processing Service (WPS).\n\n#### Resources and workflows\n\nAs an open source platform, there is abundant documentation to provide guidance in implementation, development, and customization of GeoServer. One major benefit of this option would be the ability to test new releases and features before deciding to implement them locally.  While it does require dedicated maintenance, the web API is quite simple and there is an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to store and manage data and create services. There is typically one dedicated “workspace” where map layers are created \\-- both raster and vector data can be stored and hosted as services. There are very few (if any) file size limitations that would hinder certain datasets from being shared as a service (the limits that do exist are aimed at maintaining reliable draw performance/speed). Online documentation and an active user group within the GeoBlacklight community are available to offer guidance on automation and scripting for more efficient workflows. There is support for metadata within GeoServer \\-- simple records can be added in the GeoServer workspace, and more complex metadata (if available) can be uploaded separately. Unlike ArcGIS Online, Geoserver is not itself a discovery platform, so it  would not be necessary to transform and maintain metadata records to align with an additional schema. Existing BTAA GeoBlacklight metadata could be used to populate descriptions of web services.\n\n#### Implementation \\- distributed vs. centralized\nAlthough the technical requirements and maintenance of GeoServer are not especially demanding, there must be dedicated IT support and server authorization permissions. Data files are stored in a database (i.e. PostGreSQL) with a client interface for uploading content. There are some advantages and challenges with both distributed and centralized implementation of GeoServer. \n\n#### Distributed\nThe notion that each participating BTAA institution would stand-up separate instances of GeoServer may not be practical, but it is not impossible. Unlike ArcGIS, GeoServer is not an already widely utilized tool  at BTAA institutions. It would have to be implemented as an addition to each University Library’s existing technical infrastructure. However, a distributed model: (a) allows for local control over storage and management of the geospatial data needed to create web service layers; and (b) reduces negative performance issues by coupling the database environment with GeoServer locally.  It might also mean, though, that certain institutions may implement GeoServer and generate services for their locally-hosted data, while others simply do not have the IT infrastructure, expertise, or personnel to do so.\n\n#### Centralized\nIt could be possible for a single institution to implement an instance of GeoServer that others could be given permission to access \\-- but in a centralized model, challenges arise in the storage of data files used in the creation of the services themselves.  Geospatial data files must be stored (or archived) for a web service to be generated from them. A single GeoServer instance would struggle to function adequately when accessing data stored locally at institutions across the BTAA.  Based on an informative interview with Eliot Jordan at Princeton University (where they are actively using GeoServer and GeoBlacklight) service performance and IT security issues arise in a distributed environment. It is recommended that data files used to generate web services be stored in one location that is directly connected to GeoServer. This poses potential challenges for BTAA institutions in transferring data from one institution to another for the purpose of web service creation.\n\n### **ArcGIS Online** ([https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview))\n\nArcGIS Online is a proprietary, cloud-based, enterprise web GIS platform. Organizational accounts for teaching and research use of ArcGIS Online are supported through Esri educational site licenses, though the number of named users, analysis/storage credits, and account management roles and responsibilities may differ across institutions. Whereas GeoServer is primarily an application for hosting and sharing geospatial web services, ArcGIS Online also serves as a discovery tool and visualization platform for creating maps and analyzing data. ArcGIS Online supports OGC-compliant web feature services (WFS), web map services (WMS) and web map tile services (WMTS), among others.\n\n#### Resources and workflows\nThere is [abundant documentation](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/resources) available for publishing hosted layers and web services to ArcGIS Online. Organizational accounts come with access to Esri tech support services as well as to Esri training catalog resources. There are several different workflows for creating and publishing web services depending on the desired functionality and the type of service being created. For hosted feature services, one key consideration is a workflow for [updating the maxRecordCount property](https://support.esri.com/en/technical-article/000012383), which defines the number of features that can be accessed when querying a web feature service or when downloading to create a local copy. For hosted tile layers, the [recommended publication workflows](https://support.esri.com/en/technical-article/000012383) are different depending on the size of the data set (less than or more than 1GB). While these are not file size restrictions per se, they are important to keep in mind for ensuring appropriate access to and efficiency of the hosted datasets in ArcGIS Online. The metadata workflows in ArcGIS Online are a bit more limited and more complicated than those for GeoServer. Currently, only the [ArcGIS metadata format](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/metadata/the-arcgis-metadata-format.htm) is supported for importing into ArcGIS Online. Furthermore, the specific publication workflow utilized for adding hosted layers to an ArcGIS Online account will influence the way that metadata is included with those items ([see FAQ here for more detailed information about metadata publishing workflows](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/metadata.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_CE02409EE61D4A51A2BB943A2D8D982F)).\n\n#### Implementation \\- distributed vs. centralized\nWhile most contributing institutions have access to an institutional ArcGIS organization, task force members have different roles, responsibilities, and permissions in relation to their local instance. If a task force member moved to a different job, they may not be able to continue to host the web services they had uploaded to their institution’s ArcGIS organization.  Changing ownership of content, especially between organizations, is challenging.  Because of this, we recommend web services generated specifically for the geoportal be uploaded to a centrally administered BTAA ArcGIS organizational account. \n\nCreating and distributing geospatial web services with ArcGIS Online would utilize Esri’s cloud infrastructure rather than any local IT solution, so the distributed vs. centralized technology considerations outlined above for GeoServer do not necessarily apply. \n\nTask force members would be able to upload data and create services within the BTAA ArcGIS organizational account from dispersed locations. This could work well for research data held in institutional repositories, in cases where substantial curation is needed and in person communication with researchers preferable.  In other words, storage would be centrally managed, but the labor of creating certain types of web services would be distributed across task force members. For some types of data, it may make sense to use centralized workflows. Currently much of the public/open government data is accessioned by central project staff through automated processes. Trying to coordinate geoportal records generated through these processes with web services created by distributed task force members might prove to be complicated.   \n\nAs the individual institutions participating in the BTAA geoportal project also have our own ArcGIS organizational accounts to support research and teaching, there is a separate question in regards to scope, i.e., which datasets/services might be hosted centrally in the BTAA organizational account vs. which may be hosted locally at our institutions. One way of approaching this could be based on if the geoportal task force member is directly responsible for creating the web services or if researchers at our respective institutions are creating and sharing the web services within our local ArcGIS organizational accounts. In the former case, the BTAA organizational account likely makes the most sense, especially as individual task force members cycle on or off of the project. In the latter case, the datasets/services may be hosted in local ArcGIS Online organizations, but records could still be created in the geoportal to facilitate discovery and access for these data.\n\n## Collection development considerations\n\nConsiderations for collection development as it applies to web service development would likely be undertaken by individual institutions (task force members) with guidance from the BTAA Collection Development Committee.  Each institution would play a significant role in evaluating existing and potential content for appropriateness as a web service.\n\nInitial collections to consider may include:\n\n* Geospatial data housed within academic institutional repositories that do not have web services  \n* Public or open geospatial data that does not have a web service  \n* Public or open geospatial data that is no longer being hosted by the original data creator or has a web service available from an unstable source\n\nThere are differences in the approaches to creating web services for research data (i.e. housed within an institutional repository) vs. public/open data published by state or local governments.  Research data is information already stored, managed, and preserved by a University \\-- making them a (potentially) more stable source of content for web service generation. Public/Open data from state and local governments would need to be acquired, curated, and stored locally at an institution to enable creation of web services. Some specific challenges include:\n\n### Research data (institutional repository)\n\n#### Curation\nGeospatial data within institutional repositories are available in a variety of formats and can be stored within complex research project structures. Decisions must be made item by item about how best to represent this geospatial data as a web service. It may not make sense to create web services for all spatial research data (such as water quality sampling locations for a specific study.)  \nExample: [Characterization of streams and rivers in the Minnesota River Basin Critical Observatory: water chemistry and biological field collections, 2013-2016](https://doi.org/10.13020/D6FH44)\n\n#### Multiple data layers for a single record\nData repositories often store all data layers related to a project together.  These projects are currently represented in the geoportal with a single record. It would be difficult to link multiple web services to a single geoportal record, requiring a more complex representation of these resources.  \nExample:  [Access Across America: Transit 2015 Data](https://doi.org/10.13020/D63G6F)\n\n#### Licenses\nLicenses assigned to research datasets may impact whether they can be re-distributed as a web service. Datasets assigned public domain, CC0, or CC-By licenses may be appropriate as an initial focus, whereas CC-SA or CC-ND could be more complicated.  If the web services are being hosted from a centralized location, there are also could be questions around sharing research data between institutions.    \nExample: [White-tailed deer density estimates across the eastern United States, 2008](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/178246)([Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 United States](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/))  \n\n#### Special capacities (e.g. time-enabled layers)\nSome data layers would be most useful (and true to their original purpose) if time-enabled, but it would take more work through more complicated workflows to create these web services.   \nExample: [Reconstruction of North American Drainage Basins and River Discharge Since the Last Glacial Maximum](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/182076)  \n\n#### Communicating with researchers/students/original data creators\nCreating web services will require cartographic decision-making around the best way to display each dataset as a map or image.  Communication with the original data creator may be necessary to understand the content and how best to represent it.. \n\n### Public/Open Data\n\n#### Syncing web services with data records hosted by original data creators\nWeb services created by the BTAA Geoportal project would be representations of  point-in-time copies of datasets from original data creators. This means the ability to  sync a service with the version of the dataset hosted by the original data creator will be difficult. As original data creators update, edit, or remove content from access online \\- there will be challenges in tracking what content we have generated web services for and whether or not they also need updating, editing, or deletion. The BTAA project essentially becomes the steward of a particular version of a public/open dataset when creating a web service for it.\n\n#### Curation\nCreating web services for public/open data produced by state and local governments means a local copy of the data must be stored and hosted by the participating BTAA institution(s).  Content from original data creators would need to be reviewed item by item to determine the need for a web service.\n\n#### Licenses\nThere are some cases where licenses are not clearly assigned by the original data producer. Navigating access and use constraints for data with ambiguous licenses means direct communication with data creators may be required.  Our current metadata schema does not include liability statements or licenses.  If we were to become stewards of this data, we may need to expand the metadata elements we keep. \n\n#### Communicating with original data creators\nThere may be a need for a different model of communication with data creators if the BTAA Geoportal project plans to copy and display the original data as a web service.  The current model consists of simply adding an additional discovery mechanism to the information data producers are hosting themselves. Conversations on the best way to represent the data (cartographically) as a web service may also be necessary.  Formal channels of communication regarding data stewardship and representation may need to be established in a way that has not yet been fully explored by the BTAA project.\n\n## Metadata and workload considerations\n\nIn order to add web services to our current geoportal workflow,  more attention would need to be given to the metadata for those resources.  In addition to the Geoblacklight metadata currently being created for display in the Geoportal, we would need to locate and process copies of more comprehensive metadata when available.  Currently we rely on the original data source to provide supplemental information needed to make sense of data layers. But if we are keeping our own copy of data that will persist independently of the data provider, we will need to be more attentive to this information.  Comprehensive metadata is much less standardized and complicated than the more limited Geoblacklight schema, meaning that these steps will likely require a substantial amount of manual labor.  We will also need to track actions related to the stewardship of the individual data files.  We also might need to create a second set of discovery metadata for each web service if using the ArcGIS Online platform to host.  It is unclear who would be responsible for this work since it would be challenging to standardize these workflows steps between our distributed task force but time-intensive if performed by a centralized staff.  Below is a list of potential additional steps beyond our current process that may be needed to offer geospatial web services:\n\n* Communicating with researchers or data providers to clarify ambiguous licenses and to select appropriate cartographic representations for the data  \n* Downloading a snapshot of data to serve as the local copy supporting the web service   \n* Creating additional metadata including administrative information tracking the download / processing of the web services data and relationship to the Geoblacklight metadata and (if hosting in ArcGIS) ArcGIS Item Description metadata  \n* Creating web services either by  adding to a PostGreSQL database or uploading to ArcGIS Online  \n* Adding new web service links to the related Geoblacklight metadata  \n* Tracking modifications to the original dataset and making decisions about whether to reaccession to stay in sync or to continue linking to the snapshot\n\n\t  \nWe estimate that these additional steps could add 30 minutes to the processing time for an average item. \n\n## Conclusions / Recommendations\n\nCreating web services would provide a more consistent and satisfying user experience for interacting with geospatial data in the Geoportal.  In particular, it allows users to preview data even if they do not have access to geospatial software and before downloading files to their local device.  It may also encourage meaningful connections with faculty and students interested in ways to visualize and promote their research data.  Expanding the scope of the project in this way would require, however, a substantial increase in work for task force members and project staff.  Beyond the current process of creating discovery metadata for each data layer, the project would need to download a copy of each dataset, gather more detailed metadata, generate and link geoportal records to web services, and track modifications to the original dataset.  We estimate this could add up to 30 minutes to the processing time for the average item. \n\nOne of the more important decisions to be made will be whether to take a more centralized or decentralized approach to creating web services.  If hosting content through Geoserver, a more centralized approach is recommended. This is because the services would need to be supported by a local database and it would be inefficient to set up servers at each partner institution.  If hosting through ArcGIS Online, a more decentralized workflow may be feasible.  This is because data and services would be stored in the cloud and any task force member would be able to upload data to the shared BTAA account.  More research needs to be done on the specifics of hosting using GeoServer before a recommendation can be made on the best technology option.  While GeoServer would take a greater infrastructure investment to set up and maintain, it would give us the greatest control over web service resources and the way they interact with the Geoportal.  ArcGIS Online would be comparatively easy to set up and administer, but we would have less control over performance and storage.  Also, since ArcGIS Online is itself a discovery platform, we would have to maintain metadata for both our Geoportal and their interface.  \n   \nCreating web services would introduce a new set of challenges regarding how to maintain and represent data in the Geoportal.  For research data, there would need to be significant curation and item-by-item decision-making about how to best represent each project.  For public data, the most formidable problem will be how to keep web services accurate and non-duplicative as original data creators update, add, and remove content.  In both cases, creating web services may require a kind of engagement and conversation with data producers that we have previously skipped.","src/content/docs/library/webServicesReport.md","c0869bfb89818d35",{"html":2894,"metadata":2895},"\u003Cp>This report was created by the Web Services Working Group in 2019.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#introduction\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Introduction”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Initially called the “ArcGIS Enterprise Organization Working Group”, our focus was investigating how the BTAA Geoportal project might utilize ArcGIS Online as a platform to create web services for displaying geospatial data previews.

Geospatial web services depend on a server-side / client-side relationship. That server may be on premises or may utilize cloud-based infrastructure, and those clients can access, combine, and (in some cases) contribute information back to web services from different sources without the need for local hosting on their own infrastructure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Different types of geospatial web services exist, with two of the most common and relevant for our purposes being Web Feature Services (WFS) and Web Map Tile Services (WMTS).\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>A web feature service is a dynamic, read-only service useful for directly exposing data for display and querying in a web map or web mapping application.

By linking to a web service hosted by an authoritative data provider, users are able to display the most accurate and up-to-date information available in their web maps and applications.  This decreases duplicate versions that may become out of sync if corrections or updates are made by the data provider.  Geospatial web services can also pose a challenge though for users seeking to directly access the data on which those web services have been built, as a user’s ability to download those data may be limited by the settings configured by the owner of that web service or, when the configurations allow for data querying/download, may require additional skills to carry out the necessary steps in a desktop GIS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"benefits-of-web-services\">Benefits of web services\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#benefits-of-web-services\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Benefits of web services”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Within the context of the BTAA geoportal project, providing web services would have a number of potential benefits:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cem>Ability to preview data before downloading.\u003C/em>  Web services allow users to view the spatial extent and attributes of a dataset without needing to open it in a geospatial software.

One major benefit of this option would be the ability to test new releases and features before deciding to implement them locally.  While it does require dedicated maintenance, the web API is quite simple and there is an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to store and manage data and create services. There is typically one dedicated “workspace” where map layers are created — both raster and vector data can be stored and hosted as services. There are very few (if any) file size limitations that would hinder certain datasets from being shared as a service (the limits that do exist are aimed at maintaining reliable draw performance/speed). Online documentation and an active user group within the GeoBlacklight community are available to offer guidance on automation and scripting for more efficient workflows. There is support for metadata within GeoServer — simple records can be added in the GeoServer workspace, and more complex metadata (if available) can be uploaded separately. Unlike ArcGIS Online, Geoserver is not itself a discovery platform, so it  would not be necessary to transform and maintain metadata records to align with an additional schema.

A single GeoServer instance would struggle to function adequately when accessing data stored locally at institutions across the BTAA.  Based on an informative interview with Eliot Jordan at Princeton University (where they are actively using GeoServer and GeoBlacklight) service performance and IT security issues arise in a distributed environment. It is recommended that data files used to generate web services be stored in one location that is directly connected to GeoServer. This poses potential challenges for BTAA institutions in transferring data from one institution to another for the purpose of web service creation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h3\">\u003Ch3 id=\"arcgis-online-httpswwwesricomen-usarcgisproductsarcgis-onlineoverview\">\u003Cstrong>ArcGIS Online\u003C/strong> (\u003Ca href=\"https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview\">https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview\u003C/a>)\u003C/h3>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#arcgis-online-httpswwwesricomen-usarcgisproductsarcgis-onlineoverview\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “ArcGIS Online (https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview)”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>ArcGIS Online is a proprietary, cloud-based, enterprise web GIS platform.

One way of approaching this could be based on if the geoportal task force member is directly responsible for creating the web services or if researchers at our respective institutions are creating and sharing the web services within our local ArcGIS organizational accounts. In the former case, the BTAA organizational account likely makes the most sense, especially as individual task force members cycle on or off of the project. In the latter case, the datasets/services may be hosted in local ArcGIS Online organizations, but records could still be created in the geoportal to facilitate discovery and access for these data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"sl-heading-wrapper level-h2\">\u003Ch2 id=\"collection-development-considerations\">Collection development considerations\u003C/h2>\u003Ca class=\"sl-anchor-link\" href=\"#collection-development-considerations\">\u003Cspan aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sl-anchor-icon\">\u003Csvg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\u003Cpath fill=\"currentcolor\" d=\"m12.11 15.39-3.88 3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1-3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0-3.5l3.88-3.88a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-3.88 3.89a4.48 4.48 0 0 0 6.33 6.33l3.89-3.88a1 1 0 1 0-1.42-1.42Zm8.58-12.08a4.49 4.49 0 0 0-6.33 0l-3.89 3.88a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.88a2.52 2.52 0 0 1 3.5 0 2.47 2.47 0 0 1 0 3.5l-3.88 3.88a1 1 0 1 0 1.42 1.42l3.88-3.89a4.49 4.49 0 0 0 0-6.33ZM8.83 15.17a1 1 0 0 0 1.1.22 1 1 0 0 0 .32-.22l4.92-4.92a1 1 0 0 0-1.42-1.42l-4.92 4.92a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.42Z\">\u003C/path>\u003C/svg>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"sr-only\">Section titled “Collection development considerations”\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Considerations for collection development as it applies to web service development would likely be undertaken by individual institutions (task force members) with guidance from the BTAA Collection Development Committee.

In addition to the Geoblacklight metadata currently being created for display in the Geoportal, we would need to locate and process copies of more comprehensive metadata when available.  Currently we rely on the original data source to provide supplemental information needed to make sense of data layers. But if we are keeping our own copy of data that will persist independently of the data provider, we will need to be more attentive to this information.  Comprehensive metadata is much less standardized and complicated than the more limited Geoblacklight schema, meaning that these steps will likely require a substantial amount of manual labor.  We will also need to track actions related to the stewardship of the individual data files.  We also might need to create a second set of discovery metadata for each web service if using the ArcGIS Online platform to host.  It is unclear who would be responsible for this work since it would be challenging to standardize these workflows steps between our distributed task force but time-intensive if performed by a centralized staff.

In particular, it allows users to preview data even if they do not have access to geospatial software and before downloading files to their local device.  It may also encourage meaningful connections with faculty and students interested in ways to visualize and promote their research data.  Expanding the scope of the project in this way would require, however, a substantial increase in work for task force members and project staff.  Beyond the current process of creating discovery metadata for each data layer, the project would need to download a copy of each dataset, gather more detailed metadata, generate and link geoportal records to web services, and track modifications to the original dataset.  We estimate this could add up to 30 minutes to the processing time for the average item.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the more important decisions to be made will be whether to take a more centralized or decentralized approach to creating web services.  If hosting content through Geoserver, a more centralized approach is recommended. This is because the services would need to be supported by a local database and it would be inefficient to set up servers at each partner institution.  If hosting through ArcGIS Online, a more decentralized workflow may be feasible.  This is because data and services would be stored in the cloud and any task force member would be able to upload data to the shared BTAA account.  More research needs to be done on the specifics of hosting using GeoServer before a recommendation can be made on the best technology option.  While GeoServer would take a greater infrastructure investment to set up and maintain, it would give us the greatest control over web service resources and the way they interact with the Geoportal.  ArcGIS Online would be comparatively easy to set up and administer, but we would have less control over performance and storage.  Also, since ArcGIS Online is itself a discovery platform, we would have to maintain metadata for both our Geoportal and their interface.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Creating web services would introduce a new set of challenges regarding how to maintain and represent data in the Geoportal.  For research data, there would need to be significant curation and item-by-item decision-making about how to best represent each project.  For public data, the most formidable problem will be how to keep web services accurate and non-duplicative as original data creators update, add, and remove content.  In both cases, creating web services may require a kind of engagement and conversation with data producers that we have previously skipped.\u003C/p>",{"headings":2896,"localImagePaths":2972,"remoteImagePaths":2973,"frontmatter":2974,"imagePaths":2976},[2897,2898,2901,2904,2907,2910,2913,2916,2919,2922,2925,2928,2930,2932,2935,2938,2941,2944,2947,2950,2953,2956,2959,2961,2963,2966,2969],{"depth":100,"slug":769,"text":770},{"depth":100,"slug":2899,"text":2900},"what-is-a-geospatial-web-service","What is a geospatial web service?",{"depth":100,"slug":2902,"text":2903},"benefits-of-web-services","Benefits of web services",{"depth":64,"slug":2905,"text":2906},"geospatial-data-records-in-the-btaa-geoportal-oct-2019","Geospatial Data Records in the BTAA Geoportal (Oct 2019)",{"depth":100,"slug":2908,"text":2909},"overview-of-web-service-technologies","Overview of web service technologies",{"depth":76,"slug":2911,"text":2912},"geoserver-httpgeoserverorg","GeoServer (http://geoserver.org/)",{"depth":64,"slug":2914,"text":2915},"resources-and-workflows","Resources and workflows",{"depth":64,"slug":2917,"text":2918},"implementation---distributed-vs-centralized","Implementation - distributed vs. centralized",{"depth":64,"slug":2920,"text":2921},"distributed","Distributed",{"depth":64,"slug":2923,"text":2924},"centralized","Centralized",{"depth":76,"slug":2926,"text":2927},"arcgis-online-httpswwwesricomen-usarcgisproductsarcgis-onlineoverview","ArcGIS Online (https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview)",{"depth":64,"slug":2929,"text":2915},"resources-and-workflows-1",{"depth":64,"slug":2931,"text":2918},"implementation---distributed-vs-centralized-1",{"depth":100,"slug":2933,"text":2934},"collection-development-considerations","Collection development considerations",{"depth":76,"slug":2936,"text":2937},"research-data-institutional-repository","Research data (institutional repository)",{"depth":64,"slug":2939,"text":2940},"curation","Curation",{"depth":64,"slug":2942,"text":2943},"multiple-data-layers-for-a-single-record","Multiple data layers for a single record",{"depth":64,"slug":2945,"text":2946},"licenses","Licenses",{"depth":64,"slug":2948,"text":2949},"special-capacities-eg-time-enabled-layers","Special capacities (e.g. time-enabled layers)",{"depth":64,"slug":2951,"text":2952},"communicating-with-researchersstudentsoriginal-data-creators","Communicating with researchers/students/original data creators",{"depth":76,"slug":2954,"text":2955},"publicopen-data","Public/Open Data",{"depth":64,"slug":2957,"text":2958},"syncing-web-services-with-data-records-hosted-by-original-data-creators","Syncing web services with data records hosted by original data creators",{"depth":64,"slug":2960,"text":2940},"curation-1",{"depth":64,"slug":2962,"text":2946},"licenses-1",{"depth":64,"slug":2964,"text":2965},"communicating-with-original-data-creators","Communicating with original data creators",{"depth":100,"slug":2967,"text":2968},"metadata-and-workload-considerations","Metadata and workload considerations",{"depth":100,"slug":2970,"text":2971},"conclusions--recommendations","Conclusions / Recommendations",[],[],{"title":2884,"description":2885,"year":684,"tags":2975},[696],[],"conference/map-gallery/submission-guidelines",{"id":2977,"data":2979,"body":2985,"filePath":2986,"digest":2987,"rendered":2988},{"title":2980,"description":2981,"editUrl":16,"head":2982,"template":50,"sidebar":2983,"pagefind":16,"draft":38},"Big Ten GIS Conference Map Gallery","An overview of how to submit to the Big Ten GIS Conference çMap Gallery",[],{"order":100,"hidden":38,"attrs":2984},{},"## Guidelines for submission \n\u003C!-- commented out submission form link\n!!! info \"Submit to the Map Gallery\"\n\n\t[Submission form](https://forms.gle/v6QHb8qiTdbLCVvi7) (requires a Google account)\n\t\n\tDeadline: March 24, 2025, at 5 PM CST\n-->\n\t\nThe annual \u003Cstrong>Big Ten GIS Conference\u003C/strong> provides an opportunity to showcase your creativity using GIS tools and techniques.

\u003C/MetadataBlock>\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\n- Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can use several different types of data. \n- The \"type\" introduced in this tutorial refers to the data models or formats that GIS professionals typically use to collect and share information. \n- It does not refer to the information's topic, content, purpose, source, or other aspects.\n\n---\n\n## Geospatial Information Types\n\n- Most GIS data, but not all, is stored in one of the following data models:\n  - **Vector**\n  - **Raster**\n  - **Tabular**\n\nGeospatial information can also be extracted from **scanned maps**.\n\nGIS data can be hosted online using **web services**.\n\n---\n\n\u003CTwoThirdsLayout>\n  \u003Cdiv slot=\"left\">\n  ## Vector Data\n      * Vector data is comprised of vertices and lines (or arcs)\n      * It is represented explicitly in the form of XY coordinates.\n      * The 3 basic geometry types for vector data are:\n      \t* **Points** - XY coordinates (examples: cities, schools, incident locations)\n      \t* **Lines** - connecting the points in a set order (example: roads, streams)\n      \t* **Polygons** - a set of points connected in a particular order and closed, the 1st and last point are the same (examples: a state, county, or census block)\n      * Most GIS applications do not allow mixed geometry type in a single layer\n

Vector data are usually saved as a shapefile or a feature class in a geodatabase. \n      * In Arc/Info (1980-1999), it was saved in a format called \"coverage\".\n   \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cdiv

\u003Cdiv slot=\"left\">\n  ## Raster Data\n    * Raster data is made up of pixels. \n    * Each pixel has its own value.\n    * Raster data is usually used to represent surfaces.\n    * Raster data models are commonly used for: \n    \t* digital elevation models (DEM)\n    \t* aerial and satellite imagery \n    \t* land use / land cover maps\n    * Raster data resolution: cell dimension, or the size of pixels.\n    * Raster images can consume a large amount of storage space.\n    \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cdiv slot=\"right\">\n  ![Raster Data](@images/raster-data.png) \n  *Used by permission of

**Discrete** rasters have distinct themes or categories. Each class can be discretely defined, usually ba integer values. Example, land cover/use map.\n        * **Continuous** rasters are grid cells with gradual changing data such as elevation and temperature.\n    * Raster data are usually saved in the format of raster dataset, GeoTIFF, or many other formats.\n    \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cdiv slot=\"right\">\n  ![Raster Two Types](@images/raster-two-types.png)Continuous and Categorical Data \n  *Used by permission of Paul Bolstad, GIS Fundamentals*\n  \u003C/div>\n\n\u003C/TwoThirdsLayout>\n\n---\n\n## Vector vs. Raster\n\n|   |**Vector**|**Raster**|\n|---|---|---|\n|**Positional Precision**|Can be precise|Defined by cell size|\n|**Attribute Precision**|Poor for continuous data|Good for continuous data|\n|**Output Quality**|Very good, map like|Fair to poor, depending on resolution|\n|**Data Structure**|Often complex|Often quite simple|\n|**Storage Requirement**|Relatively small|Often quite large|\n|**Spatial Analysis**|Good topology relationship|Good for modeling|\n\n\n---\n\n## Tabular Data\n\nTables with geospatial information can be used for mapping purposes in GIS.\n\n  * Tables with spatial information that can be joined with an existing map \n\n  * Tables with XY coordinate information\n\n  * Tables with address information\n\n  * Geocoded data\n\n---\n\u003CTwoThirdsLayout>\n  \u003Cdiv slot=\"left\">\n  ## Scanned maps\n    * A scanned map stored as an image file.\n    * Georeferenced scanned map: has a linked file that stores spatial information so that it can be overlayed with other digital maps in GIS. Usually stored as GeoTIFF.\n    * Un-georeferenced scanned map: The presence of coordinates in the record’s metadata does not make the map georeferenced.

Also, you will want to cite the image, indicating whetee you got it from.\nThe Geoportal provides a cite option for items, but you may need to adapt to the citation style required by your instructor.\n\n---\n\n## Copyright and fair use\n\n:::caution\nBut wait, you can't just use every image freely and in any way you want….you need to determine if an image is copyrighted.\n:::\n\nHere is a 5¢ tour of determining whether you can use an image. However, you should ask your instructor or librarian questions to be sure your use is okay.\n\nEven if the ORIGINAL is older (such as our 1750 map example), the scan of the item may be covered by copyright. Assume all images online are copyrighted unless:\n\n* It is from a FEDERAL US Government source (items from state and local government sources may be copyrighted)\n* There is another statement of rights, such as a Creative Commons license.\n\n**So, can you use it?**\n\nGenerally, if you are using it just in a class presentation or in an assignment submitted to your instructor, your use of the map would likely be considered fair use and acceptable.\nIf your content is posted online for wider distribution, such as in a journal article or electronic thesis, this would NOT be considered fair use and you likely cannot use a copyrighted image without seeking permission from whoever owns the image.\n\n---\n\n\n## More Resources \n\n### Other places to find historical maps\n\n* [Old Maps Online](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/)\n* [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/)\n* [David Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/)\n* [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/maps/)\n* [British Library](https://www.bl.uk/subjects/maps)\n\n### Video walkthroughs of placing images\n\n* [How to Add Images to Google Slides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e97Vd4CyvE)\n* [Google Docs: Inserting Images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Niyiur2RluA)\n* [PowerPoint: Inserting Pictures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-xlLwC4ERc)\n* [Word: Pictures and Text Wrapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqkEDw99szg)\n\n### Resources on copyright/fair use\n\n* [Copyright Services](https://library.osu.edu/copyright) (Ohio State)\n* [Copyright and fair use for images](https://library.owu.edu/Images/Images_FairUse) (Ohio Wesleyan)\n* [Image Copyright](https://guides.library.duke.edu/images/copyright-fair-use) (Duke)\n\n---\n\n## Exercise\n\n**Instructor:**\n\n1.

These activities may be appropriate for students at both the undergraduate and graduate level.

Frame a search strategy for geospatial data based on their research question and anticipated data needs.\n2. Perform a search for geospatial data in the BTAA Geoportal using the text, map, and facet searching features of that system.\n3. Determine how to access relevant geospatial datasets using the BTAA Geoportal based on the results of their search process.\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\n* Geospatial data are any data referenced to locations on the earth. Geospatial data provide information about the locations and shapes of, and relationships between, geographic features.\n* Geospatial data can be found in various types and formats. For a brief overview, see this tutorial about “[Types of Geospatial Information.](01_types-of-geospatial-information)”\n* The search for geospatial data will often be driven by a particular research topic or question.\n* As with other types of information sources, the search for geospatial data can be a complex and iterative process. This process can include brainstorming potential sources, selecting and exploring specific sources, and refining both strategies and needs depending on search results.\n---\n\n## Framing your search\n\nAs you get started, one way to frame your search is by asking yourself some What, Where, When, and Who questions. Your answers to these questions will help you to determine the initial scope of your data needs in relation to your research question and to brainstorm some potential sources to begin your search.*\n\n*Questions adapted from Kellam, Lynda. 2013. “Data Reference Interview.” Available at: https://www.slideshare.net/lyndamk/data-refinterview\n\n---\n\n#### What\n\n* What is my research question, and what types of analysis am I planning to carry out?\n* What data will I need to address this question or carry out this analysis?\n* What types of data am I seeking (e.g., vector, raster, tabular)?\n\n#### Where\n\n* What geographic area(s) am I studying?\n* What spatial scale/resolution am I planning to use for my analysis, and is this realistic?\n\n#### When\n\n* What time period(s) am I studying?\n* Is my analysis based on a single point in time, or am I planning to compare data across multiple time periods?\n* What is my desired periodicity for data collection (e.g., monthly, annually, every decade), and is this realistic?\n\n#### Who\n\n* Who is likely to care about this research topic and associated datasets?\n* Who has published on this topic, and what data did they use?\n* What government agencies, educational institutions, non-profits, research centers, commercial entities, or other organizations might collect and distribute these data?\n\n---\n\n## Activity 1\n\n[Use the worksheet provided](/public/documents/FindingGeospatialData.pdf) to take some notes related to these questions to help frame your search strategy for geospatial data.\n\n---\n\n## Searching the BTAA Geoportal\n\nGeoportals are systems designed to facilitate the discoverability and accessibility of geospatial information resources. They are generally organized around specific agencies, regions, or themes, and often aggregate data from many sources.\n\nGeoportals can serve as a good starting point when searching for geospatial data for a project, though no single geoportal can be considered a “one-stop shop” for meeting all data needs.\n\n---\n\n## Searching the BTAA Geoportal\n\nOn the BTAA Geoportal homepage, users can find items by:\n\n* entering keyword\n* browsing categories\n* searching with the interactive map\n\nThese options are good for an initial search in the BTAA Geoportal. Once you are on the search results page, you can refine your search using the available facets, such as place, year, subject, or creator.\nNotice how many of the facets align with some aspect of the **What**, **Where**, **When**, and **Who** questions used to help frame your search.\n\n---\n\n## Searching the BTAA Geoportal\n\nWhen you select a record in the search results, you'll be taken to its item page. This page displays additional information about the item, as well as some options for accessing the data, such as:\n\n* Direct download (generally as a shapefile)\n* Visit source (for possible downloads in other formats)\n* Open in ArcGIS (for use in ArcGIS Online)\n* Web service (to use in various desktop or online applications\n\n---\n\n## Activity 2\n\n[Use the worksheet provided](/public/documents/EvaluatingGeospatialData.pdf) to perform a search in the BTAA Geoportal and determine how to access relevant datasets based on your search results.\n\n---\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nOnce you've located relevant data for your project, ask yourself some **How** questions:\n\n* How were the data created or collected? Is information about the methodology used accessible and from an authoritative source?\n* Are the data GIS-ready? If not, how will I prepare them for use in my project? Are there any other steps related to data preparation that will be required (e.g., cleaning, extraction, transformation) before I can use these data?\n* Are there limitations on how the data can be used in my work?\n* How can I appropriately cite the data if I use them in my own work?\n* Based on my answers to all of the preceding questions, will these data be appropriate for meeting my project needs?\n\n\nNot sure how to best evaluate a geospatial dataset to determine if it is appropriate to use in your project?

Similar to a library catalog record, metadata records document the who, what, when, where, how, and why of a data resource. Geospatial metadata describes maps, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) files, imagery, and other location-based data resources.”\n\nThough it often involves extra steps beyond finding useful geospatial data, the evaluation of the data is equally important.\n\n---\n\n### Metadata's Importance\n\n\n* Metadata is important, as it allows the user to critically evaluate and assess the credibility, authority, and accuracy of the data. Metadata provides necessary context.\n* Metadata often contains information about how the data can be used.\n* Metadata also enables proper attribution and citation.\n\n---\n\n### Metadata categories\n\nMetadata records are often split into different categories of information.\n\u003CCardGrid>\n\u003CCard>\n  ![Lakes and Rivers metadata](@images/lakes-rivers-metadata.png)\n  *The metadata sections for \"Lakes and Rivers\"*\n\u003C/Card>\n\n\u003CCard>\n  ![Metadata categories](@images/data-reporting.png)\n  *Metadata categories*\n\u003C/Card>\n\u003C/CardGrid>\n---\n\n#### Temporal Information\n\nFor example, the metadata might contain information about when the data was published or last edited, but also about when the data was originally created\n\u003CCard>\n![Time period](@images/time-period.png)\n\u003C/Card>\n---\n#### Spatial Information\n\nThe metadata will usually have bounding coordinates, but might also have a textual description of the spatial extent.\n\u003CCard>\n![Spatial information](@images/spatial-information.png)\n\u003C/Card>\n---\n\n#### Attribute Information\n\nThe metadata often contains information about what attribute information is included, which can be important in selecting the right data for your project, and can also help decode the attribute names.\n\n\u003CCard>\n![Attribute information](@images/attribute-information.png)\n\u003C/Card>\n\n---\n\n#### Rights Information\n\n\u003CCardGrid>\n\u003CCard title = \"Some data might be public domain.\">\n\n![Constraints information](@images/rights-information-01.png)\n\u003C/Card>\n\u003CCard title = \"While other data may be available, but have some restrictions on reuse.\">\n\n![License information](@images/rights-information-02.png)\n\u003C/Card>\n\u003C/CardGrid>\n---\n\n#### Attribution and Citation\n\nData attribution and citation is also important, as it allows others to examine and/or replicate your work.  In the BTAA Geoportal, we provide a “Cite” link which will give you basic citation information about the data\n\n\u003CCard>\n![Citation](@images/cite.png)\n  *Cite widget in the BTAA Geoportal*\n\u003C/Card>\n\n---\n\n## Activity 2\n\nUse the worksheet provided to review available metadata to evaluate a geospatial dataset for authority, quality, and fitness for use.\n\n[Link to worksheet](/public/documents/ExaminingMetadata.pdf)\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\nAdditional resources for evaluating geospatial information:\n\nSpatial Reference Information: [Introduction to Spatial References (Esri)\n](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/core-concepts/spatial-references/)\n\n[Federal Geospatial Data Committee](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata)\n\n* [What is Metadata?](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/documents/WhatIsMetaFiles/WhatIsMetadataPDF)\n* [Metadata Fact Sheet](https://www.fgdc.gov/resources/factsheets/documents/GeospatialMetadata-July2011.pdf)\n* [Value of Metadata](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/documents/ValueOfMetaFiles/ValueOfMetaPDF)\n\n\u003C/Slideshow>","src/content/docs/library/tutorials/04_evaluate-geospatial-information.mdx","24824f2705ffd1e3","library/tutorials/05_web-services",{"id":3090,"data":3092,"body":3103,"filePath":3104,"digest":3105,"deferredRender":16},{"title":3093,"description":3094,"editUrl":16,"head":3095,"tableOfContents":38,"template":50,"sidebar":3096,"pagefind":16,"draft":38,"authors":3098,"date":3101,"tags":3102},"Find & Use GIS Web Services","Tutorial to walk through the steps of loading an ArcGIS Feature Service in several of the most commonly used GIS platforms.",[],{"hidden":38,"attrs":3097},{},{"name":3099,"title":3100},"Jay Bowen","University of Iowa",["Date","2022-12-10T00:00:00.000Z"],[3039],"import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';\n\nimport Slideshow from '/src/components/Slideshow.astro';\nimport CoverSlide from '/src/components/CoverSlide.astro';\nimport MetadataBlock from '/src/components/MetadataBlock.astro';\nimport OneThirdLayout from '/src/components/OneThirdLayout.astro';\nimport QuestionAside from '/src/components/QuestionAside.astro';\n\n\n\u003CSlideshow>\n\n\u003CCoverSlide>\n  \u003Cspan slot=\"title\">Find & Use GIS Web Services\u003C/span>\n  \u003Cspan slot=\"subtitle\">Tutorial to walk through the steps of loading an ArcGIS Feature Service in several of the most commonly used GIS platforms. \u003C/span>\n\u003C/CoverSlide>\n\n---\n\n## About This Tutorial\n\n\u003CMetadataBlock>\n  \u003CFragment slot=\"author\">\n    Jay Bowen, GIS Specialist, University of Iowa (jay-bowen@uiowa.edu)\n  \u003C/Fragment>\n  \u003CFragment slot=\"time\">\n    30-40 minutes\n  \u003C/Fragment>\n  \u003CFragment slot=\"license\">\n    Except where otherwise noted, content in this tutorial is licensed under a \u003Ca href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license\u003C/a>.\n  \u003C/Fragment>\n  \n  This tutorial is intended for GIS users with an established cursory understanding of how to use GIS software for visualizing spatial data and making maps, regardless of whether they are graduate, undergraduate, or faculty/staff users. These users may have encountered web services for GIS in formats like WMS, WMTS, or WFS, but are unsure of how to use them. This tutorial is meant to introduce users to these formats, demonstrate how to find them in the BTAA Geoportal, and show how to use them in QGIS, ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Online, and ArcGIS Pro. For an extra challenge involving the use of ArcGIS Feature Services to create [a web map with Leaflet](https://jebowe3.github.io/using-web-services/Iowa-511/index.html), please follow the [link to my tutorial on GitHub](https://jebowe3.github.io/using-web-services/).\n  \n  These slides walk through the steps of loading an ArcGIS Feature Service in several of the most commonly used GIS platforms. Please use the links provided on the Loading Web Services: Menu page to jump to the appropriate slides for your preferred software. The tutorial was designed for in-person, hybrid, and online instructional contexts. The self-guided review activity can be assigned to be completed after class, or as a live activity where students can pose questions to the instructor and other students, in person or through a chat window, as they work through it.\n\u003C/MetadataBlock>\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nThrough completing this tutorial, students will:\n\n1. Learn the basics of GIS web services - What are they? What kind of data do they host? What are the benefits and drawbacks?\n2. Locate and load an ArcGIS Feature Service with the BTAA Geoportal and their preferred GIS software.\n3. Find and load their own web service through the BTAA Geoportal and consider the utility of their data to different kinds of users.\n\n---\n\n## Intro to Web Services\n\nSeveral types of web services available to GIS users that serve geospatial data in different formats from web servers. As documented in the tutorial, [Types of Geospatial Information by Nicole Kong](01_types-of-geospatial-information), geospatial data for web services fall into four categories: vector, raster, tabular, and scanned maps. For this exercise, we will focus on the categories below:\n\n| Data Type   | What is it?                                                | Relevant Web Service          |\n|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Vector      | Discrete points, lines, or polygons                        | WFS/ArcGIS Feature Service    |\n| Raster      | Continuous pixelated data with each pixel assigned a value | WMS/ArcGIS Map Service        |\n| Scanned Map | A scanned sheet map in image format                        | WMTS/ArcGIS Tiled Map Service |\n\n\n:::tip\nEffective use of all these services will likely save you a lot of time downloading, cleaning, processing, and managing your data.\n:::\n---\n\n## Comparison of Web Service Types\n\n### Web Feature Service (WFS)\n\nFeatures: Direct access to vector data curated by the organization hosting the data. You will not need to join tabular data from one source to shapefiles from another source, and you will often have a direct connection to consistently updated data.\n\nDrawbacks: Updates to the tables are dependent upon the host. What happens if the server goes down or the data cease to be updated? For regularly updated data, it can be difficult to determine all possible values for classification purposes, if only a portion are used frequently, and the metadata are not very detailed.\n\n### Web Map Service (WMS)\n\nFeatures: Renders geospatial data as map images. Similar benefits to WFS.\n\nDrawbacks: Can be quite limiting if derived from data that were originally in vector format - loss of associated tabular data.\n\n### Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)\n\nFeatures: Access to scanned maps that are already georeferenced. Saves a lot of time considering how painstakingly slow georeferencing can be! \n\nDrawbacks: The georeferencing is not always great. You may find yourself redoing it anyway.\n\n\u003CQuestionAside>\nCan you think of any drawbacks or reasons why it might be preferable to download, process, and manage your own data?\n\u003C/QuestionAside>\n---\n\n## Locating Services\n\nFor the purposes of this exercise, let's map leaking underground storage tanks in Iowa.\n\u003CSteps>\n1. Navigate to the [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org/). Search for “Iowa leaking tanks.”\n\n2. In the results, under “Limit your search,” scroll down to “Resource Class” and click “Web Services.” This will limit your results to web services (not needed here, but it will help if you have many search results).\n\n3. Click the result entitled “Leaking Underground Storage Tanks: Iowa,” hosted by the Iowa DNR.\n\n4. In the upper right corner, under “Links,” click “Web Services.” Now you have access to a web service URL!\n\u003C/Steps>\n\n:::tip\nFor a more thorough exploration of using the BTAA Geoportal, please see the tutorial entitled [Finding Geospatial Data by Joshua Sadvari](03_find-geospatial-data). \n:::\n\n---\n\n## Loading Web Services\n\nThere are slightly different steps for loading web services depending upon which GIS platform you are using. The following slides walk through doing this in QGIS and various ArcGIS tools.\n\n---\n\n\n## QGIS\n\nNow that you have access to a web service, you will want to know how to use it in your preferred GIS software. For this exercise, we will use QGIS.\n\n\u003CSteps>\n\n1. Open QGIS and go to the Layer drop down menu. Click Add Layer > Add ArcGIS FeatureServer Layer.   \n\n      \u003COneThirdLayout>\n      ![Add an ArcGIS FeatureServer Layer in QGIS](@images/qgis-add-layer.jpg)\n      \u003C/OneThirdLayout>\n   \n2. In the window that opens, click “New” to establish a new connection between QGIS and the web service.\n      \u003COneThirdLayout>\n      ![New server connection in QGIS](@images/qgis-connect.jpg)\n      \u003C/OneThirdLayout>\n\n3.

Paste the URL obtained from the geoportal into the empty box next to “URL” and click “OK.”\n\n   :::caution\n   Make sure that you cut off everything in the address after “MapServer,” ex: https://programs.iowadnr.gov/geospatial/rest/services/OneStop/QueryEnvFacs/MapServer\n   :::\n\n5. The Server Connection window will appear. Highlight “Leaking Underground Storage Tanks” and click “Add” at the bottom of the window.\n      \u003COneThirdLayout>\n      ![QGIS Server Connection Window](@images/qgis-server-connection-window.jpg)\n      \u003C/OneThirdLayout>\n\n6. “Leaking Underground Storage Tanks” will appear in your Table of Contents.

It uses a series of control points in the digital image to associate this image with spatial locations. The digital image could be an aerial photograph, a scanned map, or a picture of a topographic map. The georeferenced map can be used for basic map analysis, such as calculating distances and areas. In this tutorial, you will learn how to georeference a historical map by using ArcMap. \n\n---\n\n## Download Data\n\n\u003CSteps>\n1.

If your reference map is only available in hardcopy format, you will need to scan the  map, and georeference it before digitizing.\n\n---\n\n## Evaluating the reference map\n\n* Spatial reference: the reference map should come with a coordinate system (projection). Ideally, this coordinate system is the same as your new feature class.\n* Scale: Your reference map should have a map scale that is appropriate for digitizing the features.\n* Resolution: for digital raster images, the resolution must be good enough to determine the shape of the features you plan to digitize.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Create a new feature class\n\n* All the geospatial features need a place to be saved. So we start the digitizing process by creating a new vector file, a new feature class within a geodatabase, or a new shapefile.\n* If you want to add new features to an existing feature class, you can simply open the feature class and skip this step.\n* To create a new feature class in ArcGIS Pro: Open the Catalog Pane, right-click on a Geodatabase, click on New -> feature class...\n    \u003COneThirdLayout>\n      ![Download image](@images/feature-class.png)\n      *Create a feature class from the Catalog Pane*\n    \u003C/OneThirdLayout>\n      * In the Geoprocessing tool, enter the name for the new feature class, and then select the Geometry Type to be created. You can also select the coordinate system for your new feature class.\n    \u003COneThirdLayout>\n      ![Name your feature class](@images/create-feature-class.png)\n      *Name your feature class*\n    \u003C/OneThirdLayout>\n\n---\n\n## 2. Create new features\n\nBefore creating any new features, you should choose a scale at which you will digitize features. This scale should clearly represent the features you want to trace. Try to remain at the same scale as you digitize.\n\n* Data editing scenarios:\n\t* Digitize new features\n\t* Modify existing features\n\t* Delete features\n* ArcGIS allows you to edit data using edit tools\n    \u003COneThirdLayout>\n      ![Edit tools](@images/edit-data.png)\n      *Edit tools*\n    \u003C/OneThirdLayout>\n* Features are created in ArcGIS Pro using templates.\n* Feature template defines the default template type for your feature class.\n* Every editable feature layer has a feature template, created automatically when the layer is added to the map.\n* You can edit the existing template, or create new feature template.\n* Generally, the template name corresponds to the layer name or a unique symbol value on which the features are created, but you can change it. \n\n---\n\n### Snapping\n\n* You can use snapping tools to avoid editing errors. \n* Snapping is the process of moving a feature to coincide with another point’s or feature’s coordinates when your pointer is within a specified distance (tolerance distance). \n    \u003CTwoThirdsLayout>\n    \u003Cdiv slot=\"right\">\n      ![Snapping tools](@images/snapping.png)\n      *Snapping tools*\n    \u003C/div>\n    \n    \u003Cdiv slot=\"left\">\n      ![Snapping types](@images/snapping-types.png)\n      *Snapping types*\n    \u003C/div>\n    \u003C/TwoThirdsLayout>\n* Choose the feature template\n* Choose construction tool: lines, curves, trace, and so on to create geometry\n* Trace the feature: then finish the sketch.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Edit geometry and attributes\n\n### Geometry editing\n\nIn case you need to modify any geometry you have digitized, ArcGIS Pro provides a whole list of tools allow you to reshape, move, or split the geometry of your features.\n    \u003COneThirdLayout>\n      ![Geometry editing](@images/geometry-editing.png)\n      *Geometry editing*\n    \u003C/OneThirdLayout>\n\n---\n### Add feature attribute\n\nAfter you have created geometry for a feature, you can add the attributes for it. You can add attributes in the attribute table or Attributes pane. Add new fields if you need more columns in the attribute table.\n    \u003CTwoThirdsLayout>\n    \u003Cdiv slot=\"left\">\n      ![Feature attribute](@images/feature-attribute.png)\n      *Feature attribute tools*\n    \u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv slot=\"right\">\n      ![Feature attribute table](@images/feature-attribute-table.png)\n      *Feature attribute table*\n    \u003C/div>\n    \u003C/TwoThirdsLayout>\n\n---\n\n## 4.

These users may wish to create easy to use free-standing analytical tools that they can run without desktop GIS software, but are unsure of how to write a script to create GUI-driven tools. \n\n    This tutorial is meant to show users how to create an open-source GUI tool that accepts a raster file and a polygon shapefile as inputs and calculates the coverage of a given range of raster classes within the shapefile polygon. \n\n    The tutorial was designed for self-guided independent learning.\n \n\u003C/MetadataBlock>\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nYou may need to know the percentage of a specific area devoted to a type of land cover, also known as a zonal statistic. For example,  you may work for a city government office charged with researching climate change mitigation strategies. You know that more trees are associated with a reduction of extreme heat. You might wish to calculate how much of the land in your city is covered by tree canopy to compare this to a desired benchmark.\n\nUsually, people calculate this by turning to the ArcGIS tool suite, or by running ArcPy in the ArcGIS Python Window. However, ArcGIS can be expensive and out of reach for many users. Moreover, apart from ArcGIS Online, the software depends on Windows, limiting its use. This tutorial will show users how to derive zonal statistics without ArcGIS tools or ArcPy scripting. \n\nIn this example, you will begin with a land cover raster for the State of Iowa and a shapefile of Iowa City. The tutorial will walk through the installation and use of open-source Python packages in Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda-Navigator to calculate the percentage of Iowa City covered by tree canopy (represented by classes 3, 4, 5, and 6 in the raster data). \n\n:::note\nThis code is not meant to be run in IDLE or the ArcGIS Python Window.\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will:\n\n1.  Use basic Terminal or Command Prompt scripts\n\n2.  Learn how to install and import Python packages, such as tkinter, gdal, and rasterstats.\n\n3.  Implement these packages with Python scripting using Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda-Navigator to calculate zonal statistics for a range of raster classes within an area of interest defined by a shapefile polygon (% of Iowa City covered by tree canopy).\n\n---\n\n**Don’t have time to download and install Anaconda-Navigator and Jupyter Notebook?**\n\n-   That's fine! You can run the entire tutorial in [this Binder site for Jupyter Notebook](https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/v2/gh/ui-libraries/Zonal_Statistics_Tool_JupyterNotebook/HEAD). Just follow the embedded link and click on the \"ZonalStatistics_withWidgets.ipynb\" file.\n\n-   If you decide to use the Binder tutorial, you may close out of this presentation.\n\n:::note\nThe Binder tutorial replaces the tkinter GUI with ipywidgets in order to handle user inputs within Binder over the web.\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Prepare Directory Structure\n\n\u003CSteps>\n\n1. Open Terminal on Mac, or Command Prompt on Windows.\n\n2. If you are using Windows Command Prompt on an institutional or office PC and it defaults to a drive other than the C drive and your user name (such as H:\\>), input the following to point it to the correct place on the C drive (replace \"johnsmith\" with your own user name) and press enter:\n\n\t```\n\t\tcd /d C:\\Users\\johnsmith\n\t```\n\n3. In Mac Terminal,  input the following and leave Terminal open:\n\n\t```\n\tmkdir Desktop/zonal_statistics && mkdir Desktop/zonal_statistics/data && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jebowe3/zonalstats_jupyternotebook/main/ZonalStatistics.ipynb -L -o Desktop/zonal_statistics/ZonalStatistics.ipynb\n\t```\n\n4. In Windows Command Prompt, type the following and leave Command Prompt open:\n\n\t```\n\tmkdir Desktop\\zonal_statistics && mkdir Desktop\\zonal_statistics\\data && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jebowe3/zonalstats_jupyternotebook/main/ZonalStatistics.ipynb -L -o Desktop/zonal_statistics/ZonalStatistics.ipynb\n\t```\n\n5. This will create a folder on your desktop called \"zonal_statistics\" and another folder called \"data\" within the desktop \"zonal_statistics\" folder. It will also download the Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file with all of the python code.\n\n\u003C/Steps>\n\n\u003CCenterLayout>\n![Media Options](@images/directory-structure.png)*Directory Structure*\n\u003C/CenterLayout>\n\n---\n\n## Gather and Prepare Data\n\n\u003CSteps>\n\n1.

The land cover classes corresponding to tree canopy are 3 - 6, inclusive...\n\n\u003COneThirdLayout>\n![Media Options](@images/input-form.png)*GUI Input Form*\n\u003C/OneThirdLayout>\n\n---\n\n## Explanation of the Code\n\n-   If you look inside the metadata xml file that comes with the land cover raster, you will see which classes correspond to which land covers. In this exercise, we are isolating tree coverage (values 3 to 6).\n\n\t\u003COneThirdLayout>\n\t![Media Options](@images/lc-classes.png)*Land Cover Metadata*\n\t\u003C/OneThirdLayout>\n\n-   Now, while we wait for the code to run, let's take a more detailed look at what it is doing...\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter.filedialog import askdirectory\nfrom tkinter.filedialog import askopenfilename\nimport tkinter.messagebox\nfrom osgeo import gdal\nfrom osgeo import ogr, osr\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy import zeros\nfrom numpy import logical_and\nimport rasterio as rio\nfrom rasterstats import zonal_stats\n```\n\nThe script above imports the packages that Python will need to make the tool run. The os module allows the script to interact with the operating system. Tkinter is a GUI package that allows you to build a dialog box / input form for the tool. The osgeo package offers open source libraries, like gdal and ogr, for working with geospatial data. The numpy library allows for mathematical computations, while rasterio and rasterstats allow you easy manipulation and analysis of raster data.\n\n---\nAlso, you should notice how these lines of code interact with the code below to link the defined inputs to the GUI widgets. Notice that you have some control over the placement and appearance of these elements within the GUI. You can also edit the text.\n\n```python\n\t##  GUI Widgets\n\t##  G-1. Shapefile Selection\n\t##  1-Label\n\tlabel_1 = tk.Label(self, text=\"Select the shapefile for your area of interest\")\n\tlabel_1.grid(row=0, column=0, columnspan=2, padx=5, pady=5, sticky=\"W\")\n\t\n\t##  1-Entry Box\n\tvar_1 = tk.StringVar()\n\tentry_1 = tk.Entry(self, textvariable=var_1)\n\tentry_1.grid(row=0, column=2, padx=5, pady=5, ipadx=100, sticky=\"W\")\n\t\n\t##  1-Button\n\tbutton_1 = tk.Button(self, text=\"Browse\", command=BrowseFile_1)\n\tbutton_1.grid(row=0, column=3, padx=5, pady=5, sticky=\"E\")\n```\n\n---\n\nLet’s look at what happens after you click “OK”. The code below defines the form inputs with some more memorable names. It also ensures that the raster class inputs are parsed as numeric values, rather than as strings.\n\n```python\n\t##  Set input variables\n\tinput_zone_polygon = var_1.get()\n\tinput_value_raster = var_2.get()\n\tlow_class_str = var_3.get()\n\thigh_class_str = var_4.get()\n\t\n\t## Convert numeric strings to integers\n\tlow_class_int = int(low_class_str)\n\thigh_class_int = int(high_class_str)\n```\n---\n\nA few lines below, you will see some code that defines the path to the raster file. Beneath this, is some code that isolates the file extension. Following this is a conditional test to isolate and define the driver, which we can use to create the new reclassified raster.\n\n```python\n\t## Get the directory path of the input raster\n\tras_dir_path = os.path.dirname(input_value_raster)\n\t\n\t\n\t## Get the file extension of the raster file\n\tfile_ext = os.path.splitext(input_value_raster)[1]\n\t\n\tif file_ext == '.tif':\n\t     drive = 'GTiff'\n\telif file_ext == '.img':\n\t     drive = 'HFA'\n\t\n\t#Define the gdal driver with the drive variable from the conditional test\n\tdriver = gdal.GetDriverByName(drive)\n```\n\n---\nThe code below takes the input raster file and reassigns a binary classification based on the range the user defines in the dialog box. If the classes are higher or lower than the input range, these will be redefined as 0. If the classes match the desired range, they will be redefined as 1. Then, the code creates a new file called “raster2” in the same directory as the input raster and sets the projection.\n\n```python\n\tfile = gdal.Open(input_value_raster)\n\tband = file.GetRasterBand(1)\n\t\n\t\n\t# reclassification\n\tclassification_values = [0,low_class_int,high_class_int + 1]\n\tclassification_output_values = [0,1,0]\n\t\n\tblock_sizes = band.GetBlockSize()\n\tx_block_size = block_sizes[0]\n\ty_block_size = block_sizes[1]\n\t\n\txsize = band.XSize\n\tysize = band.YSize\n\t\n\tmax_value = band.GetMaximum()\n\tmin_value = band.GetMinimum()\n\t\n\tif max_value == None or min_value == None:\n\t     stats = band.GetStatistics(0, 1)\n\t     max_value = stats[1]\n\t     min_value = stats[0]\n\t\n\t# create new file\n\tfile2 = driver.Create( ras_dir_path + '/raster2' + file_ext, xsize , ysize , 1, gdal.GDT_Byte)\n\t\n\t# spatial ref system\n\tfile2.SetGeoTransform(file.GetGeoTransform())\n\tfile2.SetProjection(file.GetProjection())\n```\n---\n\nThe following block of code assigns the newly defined classes to each pixel in the “raster2” file by reading the input pixel values as an array and assigning new values based on a translation of classification breaks from the input “classification_values” [0, 3, 7] to the output “classification_output_values” [0, 1, 0]. Thus, any value less than 3 or greater than or equal to 7 is reclassified as 0, while anything greater than or equal to 3 and less than 7 is reclassified as 1.\n\n```python\nprint('Reassigning raster values...please wait...')\nfor i in range(0, ysize, y_block_size):\n     if i + y_block_size \u003C ysize:\n          rows = y_block_size\n     else:\n          rows = ysize - i\n     for j in range(0, xsize, x_block_size):\n          if j + x_block_size \u003C xsize:\n               cols = x_block_size\n          else:\n               cols = xsize - j\n\n          data = band.ReadAsArray(j, i, cols, rows)\n          r = zeros((rows, cols), np.uint8)\n\n          for k in range(len(classification_values) - 1):\n               if classification_values[k] \u003C= max_value and (classification_values[k + 1] > min_value ):\n                    r = r + classification_output_values[k] * logical_and(data >= classification_values[k], data \u003C classification_values[k + 1])\n          if classification_values[k + 1] \u003C max_value:\n               r = r + classification_output_values[k+1] * (data >= classification_values[k + 1])\n\n          file2.GetRasterBand(1).WriteArray(r,j,i)\n\nfile2 = None \n```\n---\nNext, the script identifies the projection of the input shapefile and reprojects the “raster2” file to match the projection of the shapefile. The reprojected raster is then saved as “raster2_reproject” in the same directory as the input raster.

With the growing number of GIS datasets and digitized historical maps available, it can be challenging to locate the right resources since they are scattered across various platforms and not always tagged with the necessary metadata for easy discovery. To address this issue, the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Data Project launched in 2015 to connect scholars with geospatial resources.\n\nOne of the primary outputs of the project is the [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org), a comprehensive index of tens of thousands of geospatial resources from hundreds of sources. The Geoportal enables users to search by map, keyword, and category, providing access to scanned maps, digital GIS data, aerial imagery, and interactive mapping applications. All of the resources available through the Geoportal are free and open, and the scanned maps cover countries around the world. Most of the data in the catalog is sourced from local governments, such as states, counties, and cities.\n\nThe Geoportal is a useful tool because finding local geospatial data through a simple Google search can be difficult due to the lack of visibility of these datasets. The problem is that users need to know which agency is responsible for creating and distributing the data they are looking for and visit that agency's website to access the datasets. For instance, if you are researching a particular neighborhood in a city and need data on the roads, parks, parcels, and city council ward boundaries, you might need to check different state agencies, the city or the county website. But with the Geoportal, you can easily search by **What**, **Where**, and **When** without worrying about the **Who** or **Why**.\n\nThe BTAA Geoportal helps scholars find and access geospatial resources from various sources, enabling them to focus on their research rather than the time-consuming task of finding the right data.\n\n## Endorsements\n\nThe following quotes are anecdotes from Task Force members about using the BTAA Geoportal\n\n### In the Classroom\n\n\n>\"Every semester I get invited to talk to a 200-level Geography course called \"Mapping your world\". I always highlight the Geoportal as a resource for finding spatial data as the students work on their end of semester group projects. Many of the groups research regional issues focused on the Midwest and have told me that they frequently use the Geoportal to find data. While new to mapping, students successfully find their data on the Geoportal, but they don't always realize what a valuable resource this is. However, an instructor who has been working in the field for decades really appreciates that so much spatial data has been aggregated into our Geoportal, and has been an advocate for the Geoportal in the classroom.\"\n\n>\"A nursing department professor reached out to us with the idea to develop content using the Geoportal for an online course. We created a tutorial for students to search for public health data in the Geoportal and visualize it in ArcGIS Online. The students were from all over the country and interested in finding public health related datasets from their own states. In addition to the Minnesota datasets and scanned map featured in the tutorial, the students also found public health related datasets for Wisconsin, Michigan, and Maryland.\"\n\n>\"I visited a Landscape architecture undergraduate class. For their capstone project, they needed to find information for a particular town or community of their own choice and design a new feature (such as parks, service center, etc.) according to their instructor. Many students (including international students) wanted to choose their out-of-state hometown for the project, but might not have known what agency or website to visit to find the information. The Geoportal solves this by providing a platform for them to search by place for their projects.\"\n\n### Research Projects\n\n>\"A grad student was looking for GIS data for Twin Cities parks -- we used the Geoportal to search due to the map search option (combined with \"parks\" as a keyword). It turned out that St. Paul parks were part of a Ramsey County administrative boundaries data set, which would have been hard to locate with just text searching.\"\n\n>\"Kari is a graduate student in Anthropology. Her research interests are about how human encroachment influences the natural habitat in the Congo. She is learning GIS to prepare for her field trip and used the portal to find data in her research area, including administrative boundaries, roads, rivers, protected areas, mining, forest, populated areas, etc. It is hard to find this kind of related information from a simple Google map search, and the Geoportal helped her to explore her research question and prepare the background information before her field trip.\"\n\n>\"Joe A., an archaeologist, came to a Geography Awareness Week showcase that the University was putting on. I'd been invited to present that night, and I ended up talking about the Geoportal, but I didn’t have a lot of time to answer questions because there were other presenters and a short time span. Anyway, Joe emailed me the next day saying that he went on the Geoportal and that he had everything from Boone County in just a few clicks. He referred to it as \"early Christmas.\" I believe he was aware that we had township atlases of that sort, but he didn’t realize we had *georeferenced* historical atlases online like that for download, as it directly related to some research project that he and a colleague had been working on, where they were downloading and georeferencing plats one at a time. I haven’t really spoken with him since, but they seemed to be relieved at the reduced workload.\"\n\n\n## Code Repository\n\n- The code for the BTAA Geoportal is available on GitHub at https://github.com/geobtaa/geoportal\n\n- The geoportal is built with [Geoblacklight](https://geoblacklight.org), a multi-institutional open-source collaboration for finding and sharing geospatial data. We are also active contributors to the GeoBlacklight project.\n\n- The technical infrastructure for the project is provided by the University of Minnesota Libraries Web Development department.\n\n\u003CLinkButton href=\"https://geo.btaa.org\">Visit the BTAA Geoportal\u003C/LinkButton>","src/content/docs/user-resources/geoportal.mdx","088e6e846db76909","about/who-we-are",{"id":3277,"data":3279,"body":3285,"filePath":3286,"digest":3287,"deferredRender":16},{"title":3280,"description":3281,"editUrl":16,"head":3282,"template":50,"sidebar":3283,"pagefind":16,"draft":38},"Who we are","The partner institutions and team members",[],{"order":76,"hidden":38,"attrs":3284},{},"import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';\nimport { ShowcaseProfile } from 'starlight-showcases'\nimport Table from '/src/components/Table.astro';\n\n\n## Team Members\n\nOur Team Members form the core of BTAA-GIN, each contributing unique skills and perspectives.

The BTAA Geodata Archive would follow a systematic process for archiving public geospatial data created across the BTAA geographic region. Options could include any or all of the following: contract out for building a software solution and then hosting within the BTAA; contract out for building a software solution and hosting; building a software solution and hosting within the BTAA. Public geospatial data is: created or published by state, regional, or local government entity or academic institution; free and open; a recognized geospatial file format (e.g. shapefile) or aerial image file (e.g. jpg, tiff).  Archiving is a system that includes any or all of the following: file storage; archiving strategies (identifiers, replication, verification); preservation (validation and migration); curation (valuation and description). The BTAA Geodata Archive would benefit the community by ensuring long term access to a wealth of valuable geospatial data so that it can be preserved and available for the future, recognizing that data becomes more valuable over time for use as the basis of historical research, time series analyses, and longitudinal studies.  |\n\n| Deliverables Requested & Associated Timeline |\n| :---- |\n| (Indicate expected length of time the Working Group should be active and provide due dates for each deliverable.)

updated frequently as our work evolves.**\n\nWe are currently in [Phase 3: Foundation](#phase-3-foundation).\n\n\n### \u003CIcon name=\"approve-check-circle\" class='inline-icon'/>  Phase 1: Blueprints\n\nThe Blueprints Phase represents the culmination of a lengthy period of time (beginning in 2015) that we put into researching geodata archiving. The research resulted in multiple scholarly articles[^1], reports[^2], and nascent proposals[^3].  Finally, in 2023, we submitted the [BTAA-GIN Geodata Collection Strategic Plan](../../library/geodata-collection-strategic-plan/), which was approved by the BTAA-GIN Executive Committee.\n\n[^1]: See Dyke, K. R., Mattke, R., Kne, L., & Rounds, S. (2016). Placing Data in the Land of 10,000 Lakes: Navigating the History and Future of Geospatial Data Production, Stewardship, and Archiving in Minnesota.

This phase involves experimenting with a variety of datasets to test workflows, metadata, tools, and data curation strategies. The goal is to establish a **Proof of Concept**.\n\n#### 2a. Setup (Q1-Q2 2024)\n\n_Set up storage, basic ingest, and a pilot workgroup._\n\n- [x] Establish the Geodata Collection Pilot Working Group.\n- [x] Compile an environmental scan of existing geodata archiving practices across the BTAA region.\n- [x] Assess current team capabilities and identify gaps in skill or resources.\n- [x] Draft job description for a Program and Outreach Coordinator.\n- [x] Advertise the position.\n- [x] Establish Amazon cloud storage (S3) accounts for data storage.\n- [x] Develop techniques within GBL Admin for basic ingest of datasets.\n- [x] Create a few sample datasets in a GitHub repository to serve as test objects.\n- [x] Add the test datasets to Amazon S3.\n- [x] Ingest sample data to GBL Admin.\n- [x] Create and publish a Geodata Collection Implementation Plan that expands on the Strategic Plan.\n\n#### 2b. Pilot (Q3 2024-Q1 2025)\n\n_Build the pilot collection, explore technology enhancements, and document the results._\n\n- [x] Determine staging environment for sharing datasets.\n- [x] Select a broader range of pilot datasets.\n- [x] Test new GBL Admin features for data management.\n- [x] Determine minimum metadata requirements.\n- [x] Augment the GeoBTAA Metadata Application Profile as needed.\n- [x] Determine Download package contents. \n- [x] Download pilot datasets to staging area\n- [x] Add pilot datasets to GBL Admin.\n- [x] Set up a staging area (Box).\n- [x] [Separate references into Distribution table](https://github.com/geobtaa/geoblacklight_admin/milestone/2)\n- [x] [Incorporate data dictionaries](https://github.com/geobtaa/geoblacklight_admin/milestone/4)\n- [x] Continue process for interviewing for new position\n- [x] Finalize the hiring process and onboard new hire\n- [x] Document the setup and configuration processes for asset management tools.\n- [x] Produce a final report of the working group activities.\n- [x] Produce a report documenting the pilot collection and technology enhancements.\n\n### \u003CIcon name=\"right-arrow\" class='inline-icon'/>  Phase 3: Foundation\n\nDuring the Foundation Phase, we begin collaborating with select data providers. This phase emphasizes building relationships, refining curation techniques, and establishing the first official collections. This work informs the development of key protocols and processes that will serve as the foundation for the project moving forward.\n\n#### 3a. Partnerships & Technology (Q1-Q3 2025)\n\n*Communicate our newly developed capabilities and seek out data provider partnerships for our first collections.*\n\n- [x] Sunset the pilot workgroup.\n- [x] Convene a Data Curation Workgroup. (name TBD)\n- [x] [Redesign the item view page](https://github.com/geobtaa/geoportal/milestone/24)  Incorporate tabs for metadata, data dictionaries, and download options into item page view.\n- [x] Transition the updated Geoportal interface from the development branch to the live environment.\n- [x] Propose a dataset exchange workflow between data providers and the BTAA-GIN.\n- [x] Present results of Groundwork Phase to key stakeholders\n- [x] Establish partnership with one data provider\n- [x] Outline a Curation Plan that includes initial scope, workflows, and criteria. See the [Urban Base Layers Curation Plan.](../../library/urban-curation-plan/)\n\n\n#### 3b. Collection & Curation Plan (Q3 2025-Q1 2026)\n\n*Work iteratively with our data providers to collect, document, and publish prior versions of their datasets.*\n\n- [ ] Ingest datasets submitted by partners\n- [ ] Review the initial collection\n- [ ] Establish partnership with a second data provider\n- [ ] Work with partners to refine the metadata and datasets for their original content as displayed in the Geoportal\n- [ ] Implement batch ingest functionality in GBL Admin.\n- [ ] [Create a Download Package](https://github.com/geobtaa/geoblacklight_admin/milestone/3) \n- [ ] Publish a Curation Plan, Version 1 to document scope, metadata, and workflows.\n\n### Phase 4: Framework (2026)\n\nIn the Framework Phase, we will build up our collections with more data providers. This will require broader communication and more outreach. We will also be relying on more streamlined workflows by this phase. This phase will include gathering feedback from stakeholders, refining workflows, and assessing the long-term sustainability of the collection. Additionally, we will increase our outreach efforts, promoting the collection to a broader audience and building partnerships to ensure its growth and visibility in the geospatial and library communities.\n\n- [ ] Expand partnerships and collections.\n- [ ] Incorporate additional and multipart formats\n- [ ] Establish regular cycles for collection.\n- [ ] Implement additional batch processing techniques\n- [ ] Publish Curation Plan Version 2.\n\n\n### Phase 5: Outreach & Evaluation (2027)\n\n- [ ] Gather feedback from a wide variety of stakeholders.\n- [ ] Assess the project's impact on users and stakeholders.\n- [ ] Evaluate how well the first version of the curation plan functions.","src/content/docs/library/geodata-collection-roadmap.mdx","194ef491310dc501","projects/curation",{"id":3404,"data":3406,"body":3411,"filePath":3412,"digest":3413,"deferredRender":16},{"title":3407,"description":3387,"editUrl":16,"head":3408,"tableOfContents":38,"template":50,"sidebar":3409,"pagefind":16,"draft":38},"Digital curation",[],{"hidden":38,"attrs":3410},{},"## Geodata Collection\n\n- roadmap\n- Urban Base Layers\n- workgroups\n\n## Geoportal Index\n\nWe have 100,000 resource in the BTAA Geoportal for users to search","src/content/docs/projects/curation.mdx","47ebc1cb06681518","projects/profession",{"id":3414,"data":3416,"body":3421,"filePath":3422,"digest":3423,"deferredRender":16},{"title":3417,"description":3387,"editUrl":16,"head":3418,"tableOfContents":38,"template":50,"sidebar":3419,"pagefind":16,"draft":38},"Professional development",[],{"hidden":38,"attrs":3420},{},"We faciliate GIS and map librarianship\n\nSee workgroups like the Services model","src/content/docs/projects/profession.mdx","01a35e43c3062186","workgroups/arcgis-portals",{"id":3424,"data":3426,"body":3431,"filePath":3432,"digest":3433,"rendered":3434},{"title":3427,"editUrl":16,"head":3428,"template":50,"sidebar":3429,"pagefind":16,"draft":38},"ArcGIS Portals Working Group",[],{"hidden":38,"attrs":3430},{},"## Purpose\nAssessed ArcGIS Open Data sustainability and proposed BTAA and provider best-practice strategies.\n\n## Deliverables Requested\nPhase 1: Analyze problems and report for Task Force and Esri (Nov 2017).

This guide describes the pros and cons of several sources as well as what types are available in the BTAA Geoportal.\n\n## What is census data?\n\nThe U.S. Census products are the premier source for detailed population and housing information about our nation. It is comprised of two parts: \n\n1. The U.S. **decennial census** is a count of each resident of the country, where they lived on April 1 in every year ending in zero. \n1. The **American Community Survey (ACS)** is an ongoing monthly survey which started in 2005. The ACS contains much more varied and timely data than the decennial census.\n\nTogether these datasets drive government policy and help researchers, local officials, community leaders, and businesses understand the changes taking place in their communities.\n\nWhen you have a question about the demographics of the United States population, your question may seem straightforward. Because there is so much data available, it can be challenging to find the right resource to answer your question.\n\n## Where to get census data\n\nCensus data is available from a variety of places. The following table shows recommended public and licensed sources.\n\n\u003CTable src=\"src/tables/census-options.csv\"\n  columns={[\n{ key: \"Resource\",  width: \"20%\", render: \"markdown\" },\n{ key: \"Access\",  width: \"20%\"},\n{ key: \"Date availability\",  width: \"20%\"},\n{ key: \"Data formats\",  width: \"20%\"},\n{ key: \"Margins of Error\",  width: \"20%\"},\n  ]}\n/>\n\n:::tip\nSee our help page on [Licensed Data](licensed-data) for information on what licensed data is and how to access it.\n:::\n\n## Authoritative Sources\n\nNHGIS and the Census Bureau are the authoritative sources for historic and current census data. \n\n\u003Cdiv class = \"resource-card\">\n\n### Census Bureau\n\nThe official source for current decennial census and American Community Survey data is the U.S. Census Bureau website. This is the best place to look for the most comprehensive set of variables and the most detailed documentation about how the data was collected and processed, including the text of the survey forms. The website only provides access to the most recent surveys, however, and the interface can be difficult to navigate.\n\n#### Use Cases\n\n\u003Cdiv class = \"compact-list\">\n* When you only need current data, and have no access to licensed data through an institution\n* Finding quick demographic statistics on cities, states, etc.\n* Finding official documentation on tables, survey forms\n* Finding boundary files that other resources don't have (fact check)\n* Finding cartographic boundary files - better for making maps if you don't have to do analysis, especially for areas with coastline\n* Making thematic maps on [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/) if you do not have access to Social Explorer\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003CLinkCard title=\"Find Census Bureau data\" description=\"Census Bureau records in the BTAA Geoportal\" href=\"https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/99-1300\" />\n\n\u003C/div>\n\n\n\u003Cdiv class = \"resource-card\">\n### IPUMS NHGIS\n\nThe IPUMS National Historic Geographic Information System (NHGIS) provides access to census data from 1790 to the present along with GIS-compatible boundary files. This is the best place to look if you need raw data tables for historical censuses. NHGIS has excellent documentation about how the data was processed and which survey tables are represented in the data. The interface can be difficult to navigate.\n\nThere are no mapping capabilities in this tool, but datasets are designed to be smoothly integrated into GIS software.\n\n#### Use cases\n\n\u003Cdiv class = \"compact-list\">\n* Getting a large number of variables for use in a statistics program, including margins of error\n* Getting data for the whole country, at any geographic level\n* Using the data in a GIS program, where you want shapefiles and data to join beautifully\n* When you are comfortable subsetting geographies yourself in GIS\n* (rare: efficiently download multiple years of data)\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003CLinkCard title=\"Find NHGIS data\" description=\"National Historic Geographic Information System records in the BTAA Geoportal\" href=\"https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/05d-10\" />\n\n\u003C/div>\n\n## Mapping tools\n\nIf you would like to make maps using census data, there are several programs specifically designed for this.\n\n\u003Cdiv class = \"resource-card\">\n### Social Explorer\n\nSocial Explorer is a useful mapping interface for exploring current and historical census data. It has a point-and-click interface which is easy to use for focused data needs. It is useful if you are only looking at census variables and don’t need to map with data layers from other sources. The interface is the easiest to use of all the Census data options here.\n\n#### Use Cases\n\n\u003Cdiv class = \"compact-list\">\n* Making a map quickly on the website to see what variables look like\n* To make beautiful maps (static images, PowerPoint slides), and can’t use GIS, in Social Explorer\n* Easy to find the demographics you want, including searching keywords in tables and variables, and when you need really great metadata\n* Download reports that adjust for inflation\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003CLinkCard title=\"Browse Social Expolorer\" description=\"Social Explore data descriptions in the BTAA Geoportal\" href=\"https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/999-0001\" />\n\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv class = \"resource-card\">\n### SimplyAnalytics\n\nSimplyAnalytics has a business and marketing focus - with resources that contain many government and private datasets beyond the U.S. Census. Use this resource if you would like to combine census data with business or economic data. This interface will pro-rate indicators into smaller geographies than how the data were gathered, which is problematic in a rigorous statistical analysis.\n\n#### Use cases\n\t\nDownload a ready-to-go shapefile with variables already joined, especially if including non-Census derived variables\n\n\u003CLinkCard title=\"Browse SimplyAnalytics\" description=\"SimplyAnalytics data descriptions in the BTAA Geoportal\" href=\"https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/999-0004\" />\n\n\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv class = \"resource-card\">\n\n### PolicyMap\n\nPolicyMap is a community-focused resource which contains many public and private datasets beyond the U.S. Census. Because census datasets are available elsewhere, use PolicyMap when you are interested in the additional social science data. It also has a location identifier functionality which will identify the census tract number wherever you click on the map.\n\n#### Use cases\n\n\u003Cdiv class = \"compact-list\">\n- Easily make a Multi Layer Map, where you pick several data layers and find the places where they overlap, e.g. areas with a certain level of poverty, with food deserts, and low access to vehicles\n- Narrow down a study area or use interactive tool to compare areas\n- Combining census data with other unique social science data (e.g. supermarket access, quality of life indicators)\n- Mapping tool, not a data export tool\n\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003CLinkCard title=\"Browse PolicyMap\" description=\"PolicyMap data descriptions in the BTAA Geoportal\" href=\"https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/999-0003\" />\n\u003C/div>\n\n\n\u003Cdiv class = \"resource-card\">\n\n### [Living Atlas](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/99-1200-001)\n\nIf you are making maps using a subscription version of ArcGIS and only need recent census variables, the Living Atlas provides easy access to census data. The census layers feature multiple geographies that become visible as you zoom and well-formatted pop-ups.\n\n#### Use cases\n\n\u003Cdiv class = \"compact-list\">\n- Easily integrate with other layers in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Pro, but only has states, counties, and tracts\n- Good pop-up information if you are building a web map or StoryMap\n- If you are working in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Pro, easy to check if these layers are sufficient for your project\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003CLinkCard title=\"Browse Living Atlas\" description=\"Living Atlas data descriptions in the BTAA Geoportal\" href=\"https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/99-1200-001\" />\n\u003C/div>\n\n\n\n## Other sources of census data\n\nSometimes data from the census or American Community Survey will be available from regional or local entities. This data has usually been clipped to a limited geographic area and may contain variables combined from multiple census data tables. This data may be useful if it matches your study area. Since these layers have been repackaged, make sure you know how the variables relate back to the original survey.\n\n:::note[More Information about census data]\nKernik, M. and D. Bonsal (2017).

They depict building footprints, construction materials, and property uses, along with street layouts and property lines. These maps offer a unique, granular snapshot of urban neighborhoods as they existed in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe Sanborn Map Company produced the majority of fire insurance maps, but other publisher names include Perris, Hexamer, Whipple, Baist, Bromley, or Hopkins.\n\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv slot=\"right\">\n\n![A section of the 1922 Sanborn Fire Insurance map for Bellefonte, PA](@images/fire-001.jpg)\n*\u003Ca href=\"https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/3021452d-cd87-4683-9115-15dcbcee6ddf\">Sanborn Fire Insurance map for Bellefonte, PA, 1922, sheet 4.\u003C/a>*\n\n\u003C/div>\n\u003C/TwoThirdsLayout>\n\n---\n\n## Finding Fire Insurance Maps\n\nBecause they are a popular research resource, fire insurance maps have been scanned and made available in a variety of ways, some under commercial license provided by a library purchase or subscription. There is no single resource that has all the maps in one location.\n\nThis guide provides a suggested path for finding a Sanborn Map.\n\n### 1. Start with the BTAA Geoportal Search\n\n1. Begin your search with the [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org).\n1. In the main search box, enter the name of your town or city.\n1. On the results page, use the filters on the left to select **\"Fire insurance maps\"** under the **Resource Type** heading.\n\n:::tip[Search Tips]\n* **Can't find a small town?** Try searching for a larger, nearby city. Suburbs and smaller communities were often included in the map volumes of a major city. For example, East Lansing, MI, is found within the Lansing map set.\n* **Large cities** are often mapped across many volumes. Each volume will have an index map on its first page showing which sheets cover which areas.\n:::\n\n\n### 2. Browse BTAA Collections by State\n\nIf a general search doesn't yield results, you can browse specific collections. These collections, contributed by BTAA member libraries and partners, are organized by the state they cover.\n\n#### Open Access Collections\n\nThese maps are freely available to everyone.\n\n\n\u003CShowcaseText\n  entries={[\n    {\n      href: 'https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bb1g_localCollectionLabel_sm%5D%5B%5D=Sanborn+Fire+Insurance+Maps%3A+Illinois',\n      title: 'Illinois',\n      description: 'This collection from the University of Illinois contains maps that pre-date 1923.',\n    },\n    {\n      href: 'https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=01d-05',\n      title: 'Indiana',\n      description: 'This collection from Indiana University contains over 10,000 maps of Indiana cities and towns, dating from the 1880s to 1925.',\n    },\n    {\n      href: 'https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bpcdm_memberOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=b35f927e-9051-4d7f-9ca3-ad5b19024e0b&f%5Bschema_provider_s%5D%5B%5D=Princeton',\n      title: 'New Jersey',\n      description: 'This collection from Princeton University covers the state of New Jersey for the period between the 1880s and 1924.',\n    },\n    {\n      href: 'https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/999-0010',\n      title: 'Pennsylvania',\n      description: 'Penn State University has a near-complete collection of Sanborn maps for Pennsylvania.

Explore Other Major Collections\n\nStill can't find what you are looking for? If you still haven't found your map, several other institutions maintain large collections.\n\n* **[Library of Congress Sanborn Maps Collection](https://www.loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps/)** The largest collection of Sanborn maps. Many are digitized and available online. Use their [Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps Online Checklist](http://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/sanborn/) to see what they hold, even if it hasn't been scanned yet.\n\n* **[Union List of Sanborn & Other Fire Insurance Maps](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/EART/sanborn_union_list)** A catalog maintained by UC Berkeley that lists which libraries hold specific maps in their physical collections.\n\n* **[List of Online Sanborn Collections by State](https://guides.library.uwm.edu/c.php?g=824760&p=5887796)** The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee has compiled this helpful list of digitized collections across the country.\n\n* **Microfilm Collections** Many libraries hold Sanborn maps on microfilm. These are typically black and white and may be available via Interlibrary Loan. Contact your institution's library for assistance.\n\n---\n\n## How to Read Fire Insurance Maps\n\nEach city coverage begins with a graphic index to guide the user to the correct page with each page only covering a few blocks. The original paper maps used color to indicate building materials such as yellow for wood construction and pink for brick.

The Citation Guide offers helpful suggestions on the best places to find relevant citation content.\n\n## Why citing data is important\n\n**Citing data is an essential practice.** The act of referencing data sources not only acknowledges the contributions of others but also bolsters the credibility and reliability of one's own work. By attributing information to its rightful originators, citing data fosters a culture of transparency and accountability, allowing for the replication and verification of findings. Moreover, proper citation practices enable readers to delve deeper into the subject matter, trace the lineage of ideas, and build upon existing knowledge.\n\n## What to include in a data citation\n\nThe BTAA Geospatial Information Network recommends compiling the information needed for citations by using elements identified in the [International Association for Social Science Information Services & technology (IASSIST) Quick Guide to Data Citation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fiassistdata.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3uyQef4eShx4NLB8sx2vkF).\n\n* **Creator**: Name(s) of each individual or organizational entity responsible for the creation of the dataset. This is also called “Author.”\n* **Date**: Year the dataset was published or issued.\n* **Title**: Complete title of the dataset, including the edition or version number, if applicable. \n* **Publisher**: Organization that makes the dataset available by archiving, producing, publishing, and/or distributing the dataset. If the Publisher is not clear, look for an organization described in the metadata as the Distributor.\n* **Identifier**:Electronic location, web address, or unique, persistent, global identifier used to locate the dataset (such as a DOI). Append the date retrieved if the title and locator are not specific to the exact instance of the data you used.\n  \nExample\n\nDane County Land Information Office. (2019). Buildings Dane County, WI 2018. University of Wisconsin-Madison. https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/Dane_Buildings_2018.zip \n\n\n## How to gather information in the BTAA Geoportal for citation elements\n\n### Use the Cite button\nThe BTAA Geoportal offers a built-in citation tool that automatically takes information from metadata associated with data or maps and constructs a citation on-the-fly.  Look for the “Cite” button at the right side of a data or map record information page. This will produce a style-agnostic citation matching the IASSIST profile. Users can copy the information in one click.\n\n:::warning\nIf users need to conform to a standard style (such as MLA or APA), they will need to reformat the generated citation for their publication.\n:::\n\n### Other options\n\nIn some cases, the Geoportal's item view may not contain sufficient information for a citation, and users may need to investigate further. Here are options for finding the rest of the citation elements:\n\n- **View the supplemental metadata**: Look for a “View Metadata” option under the Links toolbar. If present, supplemental metadata will display in the geoportal.\n- **Download the dataset**: There may be detailed metadata embedded within the file itself or attached as a separate document.\n- **Click the “View Source” button**: This will direct users the original data provider’s website, which may include the needed metadata.\n- **Email the data provider**: The original data provider should have a contact listed on their website.\n\n## Styling the citation\n\nHow you style or punctuate these elements will depend on your chosen citation style (e.g. MLA, APA, Chicago, etc).","src/content/docs/library/cite-data.mdx","fa9ac951d791de97","library/plss",{"id":4013,"data":4015,"body":4022,"filePath":4023,"digest":4024,"deferredRender":16},{"title":4016,"description":4017,"editUrl":16,"head":4018,"template":50,"sidebar":4019,"pagefind":16,"draft":38,"tags":4021},"Locating and Understanding Public Land Survey System (PLSS) Plats","There are thousands of PLSS plats in the BTAA Geoportal and this guide describes how to search for them and how to find their associated field notes.",[],{"hidden":38,"attrs":4020},{},[600],"import CenterLayout from 'src/components/CenterLayout.astro';\n\n## What are PLSS Plats?\n\nPlats (maps) of the public land survey of the United States are a valuable resource for original land survey information, as well as for understanding landscape history. The work was done using the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), which divides land into six-mile square townships and one-mile square sections. It established the township, range and section grid; the pattern upon which land ownership and land use is based. The aim of the survey was to divide the land into lots that could be sold, or otherwise divested, to raise funds for the federal government and to encourage settlement. In general, this work took place near the end of the 18th century and throughout the 19th century. Survey dates for specific plats vary depending on the state/region.\n\nThe survey work was done by the General Land Office (GLO), an agency of the Treasury Department until 1849 and thereafter a part of the Interior Department. In 1946, the GLO was merged with the Grazing Service to create the modern Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which continues to have responsibility for the Public Land Survey on public domain lands. The original surveys are often referred to as the Public Land Survey or the General Land Office Survey. \n\n\u003CCenterLayout>\n  ![Minnesota plat](@images/plss-001.png)\n*Example of a PLSS plat for the State of Minnesota showing T027N R20W*\n\u003Ca href = \"https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/t027r20w4fi01\">https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/t027r20w4fi01\u003C/a>\n\u003C/CenterLayout>\n\n## Field Survey Notes\n\nThe work of the public land surveys was recorded in small notebooks that became the official record. Collectively these are known as the field notes. Within an individual township notebook, there is a predictable progression of entries. Most field notebooks include basic entries such as a Title Page, Sketch Map, Section Line Notes, Meander Notes, General Description, and an Affidavit. The field notes may or may not be directly connected to the plat itself in the geoportal, but links to where they can be accessed may be found in the metadata.\t\n\u003CCenterLayout>\n![Wisconsin plat and field notes](@images/plss-002.png)\n*Example of linked survey notes for T01 R01 for Wisconsin found in the Description section*\n\u003Ca href = \"https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/W6MN5J4F346LQ8W\">https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/W6MN5J4F346LQ8W\u003C/a>\n\u003C/CenterLayout>\n\n\n## Locating PLSS Plats in the BTAA Geoportal\n\nOriginal PLSS plats are not available in the geoportal for all areas of the United States. However, there are a few recommended ways to quickly see what plats do exist - by using different facets combined with the map search option.\n\n### 1. Find the PLSS collection\n\nOne of the collections in the BTAA Geoportal is titled \"General Land Office Township Plats.\" \n\n* You can use this direct link to browse items in the collection: [https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bpcdm_memberOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=77f-0001](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bpcdm_memberOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=77f-0001)\n* To find this link again, use the Resource Class facet and select \"Collections.\" Then, choose \"General Land Office Township Plats.\" A widget at the bottom is labeled \"Collection records\", which will ink to the list of General Land Office Township Plats.\n\n### 2. Narrow down by place\n\nThere are several options for finding a plat by place name:\n\n* **Option 1**: The collection page for General Land Office Township Plats features an index map that links directly to plats for some states. Click on a Township-Range in the map and a link to another page appears beneath the map.\n* **Option 2**: Click on a term in the Place facet. Most PLSS maps have state and county names attached. Township Ranges can also be found in the Place facet or users can type it into the text search. For example, use the format \"[T063N-R18W](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdct_spatial_sm%5D%5B%5D=T063N-R018W&f%5Bpcdm_memberOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=77f-0001)\" for Township 64 North Range 18 West. \n* **Option 3**: Focus the map on the search results page to your area of interest. Use the map tools (+ -) to zoom to your desired area.\n\n## Other Sources of Information and Access for PLSS Plats\n\nThe GLO surveyed and mapped much of the midwest and western United States.  If plats for your area of interest are not available through the B1G Geoportal, you can search for them in the [BLM’s digital General Land Office Records](https://glorecords.blm.gov/). This website also provides access to surveyor field notes and guides to interpreting the PLSS. State governments also received a copy of the plat maps when they were certified.  Access to these copies is sometimes available through state historical societies, land offices, or map libraries.\n\n\u003CCenterLayout>\n![Wisconsin plat and field notes](@images/plss-003.png)\n*Principal meridians and Baselines governing the United States Public Land Survey System by the Bureau of Land Management*\n\u003C/CenterLayout>\n\n### More Resources\n\n* Interpreting plats: [physical features](http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/glo/Legend_features.htm), [boundary lines and measurements](http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/glo/Legend_Boundaries.htm), [other text and tables](http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/glo/Legend_Other.htm) \n* A detailed history of the PLSS: [A History of the Rectangular Survey System](https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/histrect.pdf)\n* [Wisconsin Public Land Survey Plats and Notes Information](https://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/SurveyNotes)\n* [Minnesota Public Land Survey Retrieval System](https://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/glo/Index.htm)","src/content/docs/library/plss.mdx","63871e27ca94eb16","blog/2025-06",{"id":4025,"data":4027,"body":4042,"filePath":4043,"assetImports":4044,"digest":4046,"deferredRender":16},{"title":4028,"editUrl":16,"head":4029,"template":50,"sidebar":4030,"pagefind":16,"draft":38,"authors":4032,"date":4035,"excerpt":4036,"tags":4037,"cover":4039},"June 2025 Program Update",[],{"hidden":38,"attrs":4031},{},[4033],{"name":4034},"BTAA-GIN Staff",["Date","2025-07-03T00:00:00.000Z"],"Held in May at the University of Minnesota, Geo4LibCamp 2025 convened over 20 software developers, librarians, curators, researchers, and administrators to share strategies and tools shaping the future of geospatial data services.

With the recent expansion of the Big Ten and the addition of new geospatial resources from the West Coast, we saw an opportunity to pursue a more modern and flexible approach to managing our collections. The result is a Strategic Technology Plan for building a stack that is modular, resilient, and future-ready.\n\nThe centerpiece of this new approach is a central metadata API that will make it simpler to access and reuse our geospatial records. The API will support multiple discovery portals and access points, and it already powers a QGIS discovery plugin that is in active development.\n\nWe are moving away from a single, monolithic geoportal application toward a modular framework built on open-source Python tools. This structure lets us update individual components more easily and empowers us to prioritize data over tools, collaborate across institutions, and build infrastructure that adapts as our needs evolve.\n\nOur [2025-26 roadmap](https://gin.btaa.org/technology/tech-plan-2025) outlines four projects that bring this plan to life. Development is underway with a full rollout targeted for mid-2026, and we look forward to sharing updates along the way.\n\n\u003C/div>\n\n## Program Activities\n\n### Committees\n\n\u003CCardGrid>\n

Collaboration\n\n\nAt the 2025 Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Conference in Minneapolis, BTAA-GIN members Ryan Mattke, Karen Majewicz, and Amanda Tickner presented a poster highlighting the program’s evolution and the social infrastructure that underpins its long-term success.\n\nTitled Sustaining a *Spatial Collaboration: Leveraging Social Infrastructure to Support Technological Growth*, the poster traces the development of BTAA-GIN from an informal network into a nationally recognized initiative. It emphasizes that while technological innovation—such as the BTAA Geoportal—has been critical, the program’s staying power lies in the strong, collaborative community built across institutions.\n\n**Key Themes**\n\n- Trust, shared governance, and cross-institutional relationships as foundations for sustainable growth\n- Real-world lessons from maintaining open-source infrastructure across diverse academic environments\n- The evolving role of libraries in advancing geospatial research and discovery\n\n**Next Steps**\nThe themes explored in the poster are shaping current priorities as BTAA-GIN prepares to redesign the geoportal and move into its next strategic phase. These insights will help ensure that both the technology and the community supporting it continue to grow together.\n\n\u003C/div>\n\n## Program Activities\n\n### Committees\n\n\u003CCardGrid>\n  \u003CCard title=\"TECHnology\">\n    - Held retrospective discussion on April Data Rescue sprint with Tech and Knowledge Cmtes.\n    - Next steps: Working to get the BTAA-GIN listed as a “maintainer” in the Data Rescue Project and to add three records to their dataset tracker: NOAA Heat Watch, NCES Edge Hub site, HUD Hub site.\n  \u003C/Card>\n\n  \u003CCard title=\"Community Engagement\">\n    - Completed a series of video walkthroughs of the Geoportal for discovering and opening resources that demonstrates all of the search features and filters.

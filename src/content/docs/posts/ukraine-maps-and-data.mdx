### Feature: Ukraine Maps and Data





### This post lists geospatial resources related to Ukraine from many sources around the world. While the Geoportal does contain [some maps of Ukraine](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdct_spatial_sm%5D%5B%5D=Ukraine&amp;view=mapview), they are from non-Ukrainian agencies and primarily date back to WWII (or older); these maps may not provide the information our users are currently seeking. Librarians from the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Information Network (BTAA GIN) Project Team have compiled some additional, more current resources for Geoportal visitors.

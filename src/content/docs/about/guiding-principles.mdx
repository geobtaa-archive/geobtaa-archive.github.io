## Our Mission

To support the geospatial research community by making resources easier to find and to foster connections among geospatial library professionals through our collaboration.

* Our program aims to support the geospatial research community by building and maintaining a collective open-source spatial data infrastructure featuring metadata optimized for spatial discovery platforms.
* We foster connections among geospatial library professionals, the Big Ten Academic Alliance, and the BIG Collection by sharing expertise and utilizing collective resources while cultivating a culture of deep collaboration and interdependence.

## Our Values

### 1. Collaboration & Connection

* Provide a centralized resource discovery platform to connect data creators, providers, and consumers.
* Provide a collaborative social infrastructure for librarians and geospatial specialists.
* Create opportunities for engaging in joint research and sharing scholarly outputs.

### 2. Diversity, Equity, & Accessibility

* Lower barriers to accessing geospatial data across a wide range of communities.
* Create educational resources fostering geospatial literacy.
* Strive to identify resources that represent diversity in topics, geographic regions, time periods, communities, and languages.

### 3. Stewardship & Sustainability

* Invest in open-source technology and communities.
* Share metadata best practices and schema development.
* Champion initiatives to preserve and archive digital geospatial assets.

## Our Vision

To preserve and share at-risk digital geospatial assets by building a complete spatial data infrastructure.


## Our Technical Values

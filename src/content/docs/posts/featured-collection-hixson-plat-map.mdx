#### What’s in this collection?

The [Hixson Plat Map Atlases of Iowa](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgeo.btaa.org%2Fcatalog%3Ff%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D%3D03d-02&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Is0czRsaqIxOtzMob_2-n) digital collection contains the 1930 editions of Hixson plat books for 95 of Iowa’s 99 counties. Plat books are atlases showing rural land ownership and property boundaries, or real property. A plat atlas generally has a map of the featured county showing the townships and sections as laid out by surveyors. Each page of the atlas is plat of the individual townships (36 square miles) within the county, identifying who owns individual parcels of land and the number of acres in each parcel. The plat shows township sections, roads, railroads, boundaries of towns and urban areas, and bodies of water. Local schools, churches and cemeteries are also noted on each map.<br/><br/>Since plat maps can be used to trace property ownership over time, they are often sought out by genealogists or people interested in family histories, as well as by historians.<br/><br/>

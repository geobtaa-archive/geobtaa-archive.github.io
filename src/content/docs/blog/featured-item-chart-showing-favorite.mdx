### About the author

Matthew Fontaine Maury (1806-1873) was a naval officer, hydrographer, and one of the creators of the discipline of oceanography. A leg injury left him unable to serve which led him to the study of meteorology and oceanography. His book “[The Physical Geography of the Sea](https://www.blogger.com/#) [and its Meteorology](https://www.blogger.com/#)” is considered the first modern textbook on the topic.<br/><br/><br/><a href="https://www.blogger.com/#"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgTIYlv5TBembCUSfwPCiw4wgEDOt5bHMp7giNPz6fvVssOK2TbtuJ83npD5qMdaSDV6TT8JEWCqDHAwIIsfIM9hhAfZtu6aJL3W5kc6ubk7-lFftuhRUQ51GIJVaxAkVNazKg6Y3nqODlDcn85lIMWIrvOhmpk-j1WYcADGi08YTdT1z7u2tdwyOFE6g=w301-h400"/></a>

### Interesting tidbit

The map’s legend is text-only, it simply says “red” and “blue” beside the corresponding whale species.<br/><br/>

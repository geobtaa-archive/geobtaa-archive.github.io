## Interesting tidbits:


- The 2000s in Chicago saw investments in green and public spaces and changes to zoning and land uses that are apparent when comparing the 2003 imagery to later years.
- A series of [public spaces opened](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2019/12/24/column-rating-chicagos-latest-wave-of-parks-and-public-spaces-by-the-three-es-theyre-better-on-entertainment-and-ecology-than-equity/) in Chicago beginning in 2004. The 2003 imagery shows the construction of [Millennium Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Park#Reception_and_recognition), a highly celebrated and controversial public space. It is also home to [Cloud Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Gate), commonly referred to as the “Bean.”

- In 2004 Chicago approved a new zoning ordinance in response to a [boom in residential construction](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1401.html) that was, at least in part, to protect the aesthetics of Chicago neighborhoods. However, there is also a correlation between the [increase in discrete zoning districts](https://www.stevencanplan.com/2016/05/oh-how-chicago-land-use-is-controlled-by-spot-zoning/) since the ordinance passed. A comparison of the 2003 aerial imagery to later years will show the impact of the zoning measures.

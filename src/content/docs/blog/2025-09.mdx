## BTAA Geoportal Video Tutorials: Step-by-Step Search Walkthroughs

To make the BTAA Geoportal even easier to use, we've launched a new series of [video tutorials](../../library/geoportal-video-tutorials) demonstrating common BTAA Geoportal search strategies applied to real datasets. These short walkthroughs show practical techniques for combining keywords, filters, and map-based searches to quickly locate the data you need.

**Watch the full series on [our YouTube Channel: @GeoBTAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbFjvVNI4-M&list=PLNMgmHMZCEbc-QJZP12rKa1YtFjgD-7Vh)**

The tutorial series includes:
- Intro to the Geoportal:  What it is and how to get started
- Vector Dataset Search:  Finding redlining maps for Pennsylvania cities
- Historic Map Search:  Exploring digitized campus maps from Big Ten universities
- LiDAR Land Cover Search:  Using Iowa's 2009 dataset as an example
 
Designed for researchers, students, and librarians alike, these tutorials help users navigate the Geoportal more effectively and discover datasets with confidence.

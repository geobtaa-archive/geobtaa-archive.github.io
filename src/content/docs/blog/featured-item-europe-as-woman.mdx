#### What is the item?

This item, titled in our catalog [Europe as a woman], is a version of the Europa Regina appearing in one of the volumes of Sebastian Münster’s Cosmographia. Münster was a 16th century German cartographer, and Cosmographia was the first German-language depiction of the world. The original Europa Regina was drawn by Johannes Putsch, a poet. This map gained popularity in the late 16th century after being included in one of the later versions of Cosmographia. <br/><br/>

#### Interesting tidbits:


- There are many interpretations of the queen’s pose here. At the time, Charles V controlled the Roman Empire as well as Spain; it’s possible that is why Spain is her head.
- It is also possible that she is holding the orb (Sicily) and turned to the right in an offering of power to her husband, Charles V.

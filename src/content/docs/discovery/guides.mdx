Our Research Guides provide general finding aids for topical resources.



<h3>[U.S. Census Data](../../guides/census)</h3>

Census data is available from many different sources, formats, and geographies. This guide describes the pros and cons of several sources as well as what types are available in the BTAA Geoportal.


<h3>[Fire Insurance Maps](../../guides/fire-insurance)</h3>

Fire insurance maps, including Sanborn Maps, are among the most commonly sought after items in the BTAA Geoportal. This guide explains how to find these resources and how to interpret their symbology. 

<h3>[Public Land Survey System (PLSS) Plats](../../guides/plss)</h3>

There are thousands of PLSS plats in the BTAA Geoportal and this guide describes how to search for them and how to find their associated field notes.

<h3>[Licensed data](../../guides/licensed-data)</h3>

Most of the resources in the BTAA Geoportal are free and open, but we also include an index of licensed databases commonly accessed by researchers affiliated with a BTAA university.  The Licensed Data research guide explains how to interpret those records and access the data.

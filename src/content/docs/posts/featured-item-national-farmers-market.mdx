<br/>Interesting tidbits:<br/><br/>
- Several states in the Big Ten region have the most farmers markets in the country. The populous states of California (756) and New York (672) are #1 and #2, but the next states are Michigan (342), Ohio, (340), and Illinois (337). Wisconsin (312) and Pennsylvania (308) are in the top 10 as well.

- The metadata for this dataset was pulled from the [Esri Coronavirus Hub](https://coronavirus-resources.esri.com). Tracking the locations of grocery sources has been part of public health assessments during the pandemic.

- The dataset was created by the [Urban Observatory](https://www.urbanobservatory.org/), a project by Richard Saul Wurman, Radical Media, and Esri that creates an interactive museum experience that uses digital maps and the power of geospatial analysis to bring important and interesting data collected about our cities to life.

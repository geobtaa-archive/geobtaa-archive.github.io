### Interesting tidbits:


- Railways were an influential component to the incredible population growth in Chicago during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
- The map uses color to denote North, West, and South Chicago, whose boundaries are largely formed by branches of the Chicago River.
- The Chicago Park and Boulevard System is also highlighted in green. The system is a series of parks connected by wide streets with central medians containing planted dividers. 26 miles of the system are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

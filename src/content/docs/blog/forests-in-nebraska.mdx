The largest human-planted forest in the Western Hemisphere is the Nebraska National Forest, specifically its Bessey Ranger District near Halsey, Nebraska. This expansive forest spans approximately 90,000 acres and was established in the early 1900s by Charles E. Bessey, a pioneering botanist with a vision to create a forest in the middle of the treeless Sandhills. Today, it stands as a testament to ecological ambition and perseverance, providing a diverse habitat for wildlife, a resource for timber, and a recreational haven for visitors.

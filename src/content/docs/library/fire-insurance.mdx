## What are Fire Insurance maps?

Fire insurance maps are detailed city plans originally created to evaluate fire risk. They depict building footprints, materials, and uses, along with street layouts and property lines—offering a detailed view of urban neighborhoods as they appeared in the 19th and 20th centuries.

## How can I find scanned fire insurance maps?

Because they are a popular research resource, fire insurance maps have been scanned and made available in a variety of ways, some under commercial license provided by a library purchase or subscription. Additionally, some libraries have scanned and made their own maps freely available.  

{/* * In the Geoportal search box, search for your town name.
* Then select “Fire insurance maps” in the Resource Type facet in the left ribbon. */}


There is no single resource that has all the maps in one location.  Some BTAA libraries has made maps in their state available through the Geoportal.

For other states, you will find an entry point to two state level subscription products: Digital Sanborn Maps (Black & White): 1687-1970 and Fire Insurance Maps Online (FiMO). Your institution may or may not subscribe to the product listed. If you do not have subscription access through your institution, try the [Library of Congress Sanborn map collection](https://www.loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps) or your state library may have a subscription.

If your town name search doesn't turn anything up in the geoportal, you can still try searching by state and then seeing if the town shows up geographically where you would expect it to.  Remember, only town centers (i.e. populated places) and industrial sites were mapped, but also that smaller towns or neighborhoods may be mapped with larger towns.  For example, East Lansing, MI is in the Lansing Sanborn map, but not listed as an East Lansing map.

:::tip[Search Tips]

Occasionally a suburb will not be mapped as its own town but will be included in the back volumes of the larger city. Make sure you check nearby town names if you are not finding the one you are searching for.

Large cities will be mapped over many, many volumes.  Each volume will begin with an index showing what is included in that volume.

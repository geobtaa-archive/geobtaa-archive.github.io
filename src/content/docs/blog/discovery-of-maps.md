Geological maps are a valuable resource for understanding characteristics of earth properties through rock and mineral formations. Historical geological maps held within map collections can span geographic areas and be useful for understanding regions across administrative regions, such as state borders. The BTAA Geoportal can be a source for identifying where to look for historic geological map collections within BTAA institutions. This blog post will highlight what types of geological maps are able to be located from the BTAA Geoportal as of Spring 2025. Geological maps are a resource type for narrowing down specific map types. See this search for Resource type (Geological maps) for results. These historic geological maps are primarily from the early half the 1900s, with some earlier geological maps as well that date back to the mid-1800s. Of the results, the following institutions have materials classified as geological maps discoverable from the BTAA Geoportal: Penn State University, University of Michigan, Indiana University, University of Minnesota, The Ohio State University, Northwestern University, and University of Maryland. These historic geological maps can also be seen within the BTAA Geoportal's Libraries Historical Maps Collection. Of the 1,354 geological maps, 1,160 geological maps are from Penn State University's Bituminous coal mine maps of Pennsylvania.

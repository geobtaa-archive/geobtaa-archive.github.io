#### What is the item?

The University of Chicago’s GIS Data Hub is a portal to a curated set of historical Chicagoland data. There are currently 33 vector layers covering different themes. The data was produced by several sources, including UChicago researchers and Library Map Collection staff.<br/><br/>

#### What BTAA Library submitted the item?

University of Chicago<br/><br/>

#### Interesting tidbits:


- The collection contains the city boundaries for Chicago starting in 1868.
- Ward boundaries for the years 1986, 1992, and 1998 are popular layers for researchers interested in redistricting and social outcomes.
- The 77 community areas as of 1990 are available, and continue to be very similar to contemporary areas.
- A number of layers were derived from a 1948 dissertation by Henry Hughes Presler, titled "The effects of subsidy of Presbyterian Churches in metropolitan Chicago, 1871-1942." In the dissertation, Presler maps religious congregations and their ethnic makeup.
- The hub also includes 1925 world boundaries at the country level.

#### Where can I find out more?


- The city boundaries represent the history of Chicago’s land annexation. The [Encyclopedia of Chicago](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fencyclopedia.chicagohistory.org%2Fpages%2F53.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcZjmuqk5WTY90bU9PNguVIk3hcA) provides an interesting entry on these annexations by Louis P. Cain.
- The [Encyclopedia of Chicago](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fencyclopedia.chicagohistory.org%2Fpages%2F1316.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRrXiU4M1Nijfh1FMjxgr2cO1wpQ) also has an introduction to Chicago’s Ward System by Douglas Knox. More recently, Rober Vargas of UChicago Sociology studied the social outcomes of changing Chicago ward boundaries in [Wounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Foxford.universitypressscholarship.com%2Fview%2F10.1093%2Facprof%3Aoso%2F9780190245900.001.0001%2Facprof-9780190245900&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIfir4mbJUbjkJPrv3f5jSTjzdvg).
- The community areas stem from the Social Science Research Committee at UChicago in the early 20th century. More information is available through the [UChicago Special Collection Research Center](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lib.uchicago.edu%2Fe%2Fscrc%2Ffindingaids%2Fview.php%3Feadid%3DICU.SPCL.SSRC&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBhPt68NRNyTH4fLI6Y3e188IhPQ) and [Map Collection](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lib.uchicago.edu%2Fe%2Fcollections%2Fmaps%2Fssrc%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEO_INFH7XCU8IHf2RXB6eimOaIJA).

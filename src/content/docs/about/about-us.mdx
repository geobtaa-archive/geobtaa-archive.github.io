The Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Information Network (BTAA-GIN) is a collaboration of library-affiliated staff from the Big Ten Academic Alliance universities. We support geospatial research, foster connections among library professionals, and advance the development of open-source geospatial tools and resources.

## Our work

We focus on two key areas: **technical infrastructure** and **social infrastructure**, both of which contribute to supporting the geospatial research community and providing a collaborative environment.

### Technical Infrastructure

* **BTAA Geoportal**: We build and maintain the [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org) to improve discovery of geospatial resources.
* **Metadata Aggregation & Augmentation**: We aggregate, enhance, and optimize metadata records for geospatial resources, enabling discoverability across platforms.
* **Open Source Contributions**: We actively contribute to open-source geospatial communities, including [GeoBlacklight](https://geoblacklight.org), [OpenGeoMetadata](https://opengeometadata.org), and [Geo4Lib](https://geo4lib.org).

### Social Infrastructure

* **Collaboration**: We create opportunities for geospatial library professionals to collaborate, share knowledge, and exchange best practices.
* **[Annual GIS Conference](~/conference)**: Our annual virtual conference brings together students, emerging professionals, and seasoned workers to present their research and foster networking in the geospatial information science community.
* **[Reference Guides](~/guides) & [Educational Resources](~/tutorials)**: We develop and provide resources related to geospatial research and GIS to support academic and professional growth.


## Our Connection to the BTAA

BTAA-GIN is part of the broader [Big Ten Academic Alliance Library Initiatives](https://btaa.org/library/Libraries), which brings together the collective expertise and resources of Big Ten libraries to support the academic missions of member institutions.
